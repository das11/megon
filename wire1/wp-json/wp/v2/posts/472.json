To which we could say that the problem is not how much traffic you attract but if you are appealing to the correct one (your target audience).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say your website attracts 500 users per day; but in reality, what is the percentage of that quantity that is going to change from visitor to lead and from lead to a good conversion rate?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are six easy and practical steps to attract your desired audience to your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Identify your target market<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the needs my product or service fulfills? Who is most likely to use my product\/service? What is my customer\u2019s age, purchasing power, geographical location and marital status? These are some of the questions you have to ask to narrow down your focus and identify your target market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you identify your target customer, you are ready to invest in a content publication strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Blogging<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding more content to your site helps to update it and consequently to get more traffic, besides it shows Google your site is up to date and well-maintained.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-maintained, active blog helps to establish brand loyalty, increasing this way your conversion rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several free blogging platforms like WordPress.com or Weebly.com; however the advantages of hosting your blogs on your business website are endless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogging on your website increases your search engine traffic since the more content you add, the more search visibility. Besides, you have more chances to rank for various keywords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. High-quality content<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to verify you are producing top-quality content that is relevant to your business and your services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an expert, and an authority on the topic you publish is extremely important. Your customers want verified information from an expert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Improve every post for SEO<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with quality content, you must improve every post for SEO. Use your keywords correctly; this can make a difference between potential clients and converting clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users look at the top few search results, and if they don\u2019t find what they are looking for, they\u2019ll adjust their search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Amplify content<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you add new content or publish an original blog post to your site, expand it on newsletters, articles and social media.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your followers should find your content interesting, and your job is to come up with captivating reasons for them to read this new content and get them back to your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using industry-specific and other appropriate hashtags and sharing them regularly on social media along with your quality content; is one of the easiest ways to get followers on your site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get even more exposure, consider advertising your content on Facebook, the number one most used social media site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Ask your audience to share your content<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The single most natural way to attract new clients is by word of mouth. Think about your current customers as one of your most significant assets; they are the doorway to growing your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Satisfied customers usually are more than happy to recommend and endorse your business to all of their friends and colleagues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask them to help you, get referrals from them and offer a prize to those who send colleagues or friends to your website. Going out of your way and showing your appreciation, only makes your happy customers want to help you even more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using a combination of all of the practices mentioned above, you will be able to lead your target audience to your website, so they can eventually become a customer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DG Studio takes pride in helping our clients reach their business goals.&nbsp;Schedule an appointment&nbsp;today to get in touch with our Creative Product Specialist Antonio and see how we can help your business!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The most common problem for a brand new online business is attracting the ideal audience to its website which can translate into lack of traffic.
