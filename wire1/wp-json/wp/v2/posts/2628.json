Did you know that nearly&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/blog\/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail\">50 percent of small businesses<\/a>&nbsp;fail by year five? Why do you think that is?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most small businesses that go under, it&#8217;s because they simply couldn&#8217;t bring in enough clientele to make a profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a new year comes new advertising trends. What will be important this year? How will you make your business stand out above your competitors?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at five of the top advertising trends you need to keep an eye on in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. SEO Isn&#8217;t Going Away Any Time Soon<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re probably tired of hearing about SEO and how it affects your business website and potential clientele. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/internet-marketing\/\">search engine optimization<\/a>&nbsp;and PPC marketing are&nbsp;still the leading contributors to getting traffic to your website. When users search for content, products, or services in your industry, your website needs to be among the first to come up in the search results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you&#8217;re staying active on your website by adding content to your blog, updating pages, and responding to consumers. You also need to make sure you&#8217;re using multiple forms of media embedded with metadata, keywords, and inbound and outbound links throughout your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Social Media is Still a Major Player<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media is one of the most important advertising trends. Nearly&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2019\/05\/16\/facts-about-americans-and-facebook\/\">70 percent of American adults<\/a>&nbsp;use Facebook. Are you maximizing your impact on this social media platform?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use social media for marketing organically using your current followers. Post engaging and interactive content and encourage your followers to share, like, and comment on your post so their friends will see it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can utilize paid social media marketing, which allows you to target specific users and gives you vital feedback on each ad&#8217;s performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Influencer Marketing is Hitting Its Stride&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you lack a strong social media presence, you can rely on someone else&#8217;s popularity to advertise your business.&nbsp;Influencer&nbsp;marketing is one of the most popular advertising trends wherein business owners strike up marketing deals with social media users with large followings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can trade products, services, or payments for the influencers to mention you in their post, directly advertise your products, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Landing Pages Are a Potent Product Peddler<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another significant advertising trend of 2020 falls back on landing page marketing. Landing pages are pop-up content windows that direct people with a strong call to action while&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/what-characteristics-do-buyers-look-for-when-purchasing-a-product-online\/\">shopping online<\/a>. Landing pages can be used on other&nbsp;websites, your website, social media pages, and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is strongly encouraging people through your landing page to buy your products or services or subscribe to an email list. You can use powerful incentives, like offering free content, exclusive savings, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Retargeting Marketing Brings Undecided Consumers Back to You<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, consider using retargeting advertising techniques to bring people back who visited your website but didn&#8217;t convert to a customer. Retargeting advertising uses cookies that attach to users&#8217; computers. These cookies place advertisements from your company on their screens once they leave your site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be a powerful nudge in the right direction for people who were on the fence. Most people don&#8217;t buy a product or service the first time they see it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking for More Advertising Trends and Advice?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking at making the most of 2020, you must pay attention to advertising trends. We live in a highly capitalistic society. It&#8217;s a dog-eat-dog world out there, and only the strongest business will survive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, no one expects you to have all the answers.
