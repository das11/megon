You may have an optimized product page on your entire site, but for some reason, people just aren\u2019t visiting as regularly. After all, the end-goal for optimizing product pages is to appear in the top results of the lead search engine. Without visual elements such as high-quality images of your product or service, keywords relevant to the product\u2019s description in the page\u2019s title tags, customer testimonials, proper image spacing, consistent logo and branding placement; customers aren\u2019t as likely to convert. While driving traffic to your homepage is essential, it\u2019s undoubtedly more critical to get customers to your product pages, since they are the parts of your website that are doing the selling and converting visitors into buyers. These are some of the pitfalls you will need to avoid to prevent your site from losing traffic and sales:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Why Is Your Website Losing Traffic and Sales?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A poor product description could prevent consumers from buying. Ultimately, we are all influenced positively or negatively by immediate impressions \u2013 page images, and convinced by language \u2013 product descriptions. A product or service description should be unique and emotive. You are indeed trying to provoke a reaction, based on a desire to buy and a need for further information or an immediate purchasing action.&nbsp;Why is my website losing traffic? It\u2019s one of the most common concerns. You may have an optimized product page on your entire site, but for some reason, people just aren\u2019t visiting as regularly. After all, the end-goal for optimizing product pages is to appear in the top results of the lead search engine. Without visual elements such as high-quality images of your product or service, keywords relevant to the product\u2019s description in the page\u2019s title tags, customer testimonials, proper image spacing, consistent logo and branding placement; customers aren\u2019t as likely to convert. While driving traffic to your homepage is essential, it\u2019s undoubtedly more critical to get customers to your product pages, since they are the parts of your website that are doing the selling and converting visitors into buyers. These are some of the pitfalls you will need to avoid to prevent your site from losing traffic and sales:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. No Case Studies<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know about the importance of social proof, some types include reviews, testimonials, social shares and, of course, case studies. This last one shows people who visit your site and are thinking about doing business with you that others like them have used your products and services effectively. The purpose is to win new customers by demonstrating the success that existing customers have already experienced with your product or service. That\u2019s why some people call them customer success stories. If you don\u2019t include case studies in your product\u2019s page, you are missing the chance of showing off what your customers love about you, which helps inspire trust&nbsp; for new customers and is suitable for both SEO and your online reputation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Unoptimized Keywords<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyword optimization is the act of researching, analyzing and selecting the best keywords. The goal is to target and to steer qualified traffic from search engines to your product\u2019s pages. Keyword search optimization is a fundamental step in the initial stages of search engine marketing; therefore, if you do a lousy job at selecting your target keywords, all your future efforts will be in vain. So it\u2019s essential to get keyword optimization right. If you don\u2019t choose and use keywords your customers are searching for, you won\u2019t be found, that means no traffic, no conversions, no sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Lack of A Clear Message<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your message has to be clear since your headline and tagline are a fast way to tell people what your site is about. People don\u2019t want to spend too long searching your website to see if you have what they want. They want a website with a clear message. Don\u2019t assume people get you. Creating a decent headline and tagline for your product\u2019s site forces you to think about your core business. And it\u2019s critical that you know what you are trying to convey precisely, it should be understandable for everyone. People want clarity when they visit a website for the first time; they have to be able to answer the following questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Do I understand this website? Is it clear what the product\u2019s benefits are?<\/li><li>Where or how can I get these benefits?<\/li><li>In other words, is it clear what your product or service is offering by just reading your website\u2019s headline and tagline?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Missing Original Content<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your website\u2019s information should give your audience something valuable but original; this means something different from other blogs, articles or sites, in other words, it should offer something different to the rest of information that is out there. Google\u2019s mission reads \u2018to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\u2019 So, it\u2019s essential that your information is something that is accessible and useful for your audience. This is why original content is so important for SEO. It\u2019s important to mention that your professional opinion on a particular topic counts as original content and will help towards building your brands authority and credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating all of these elements will contribute to greater conversions and ultimately sales.
