And thanks to your marketing strategies, you\u2019re getting traffic to your site. So, why is it that a large number of your visitors are not converting into leads and customers? Why are they leaving your site? Consider if you are making any of the following mistakes to cause visitors not to stick around:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Your navigation structure is unclear<\/strong><br>Complex, inconsistent navigation can be very frustrating for a website visitor, especially if he gets caught in a never-ending maze of poor navigation options. Your website navigation should be intuitive, logical, and easy to understand. Don\u2019t provide visual elements that aren\u2019t clear in defining where the user is and what they\u2019re supposed to do next. For extensive websites try adding a sitemap, this way you are taking your user\u2019s needs into account and you will stop losing potential customers due to lousy content organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Bad content structure<\/strong><br>When you organize your content try to look at it from your user\u2019s perspective rather than from your own, while you may understand it, your visitors may struggle to find specific information. Your site\u2019s information should be easy to find, and your users should be able to understand it correctly. Don\u2019t distribute your content across multiple pages; instead, it\u2019s a good idea to group content such as similar topics and essential information. Also, use bold headings and highlight specific keywords you believe your visitors would be searching for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Poor content legibility<\/strong><br>Your website\u2019s design is not only about images, colors, and graphics; it is also about the consistency of color and fonts, the type of fonts you use, as well as the colors of your text and background, keeping the correct spelling, and a quality layout. The lack of consistency in any of these factors will not only confuse your users as they navigate throughout your site\u2019s pages, but it will hinder your website\u2019s UX as well. It is advisable to stay with high contrast color combinations and clean, free serif fonts for best results. And for the font size, your best bet is to use larger fonts to give visitors a better experience so that they can read and digest the content of your website. Your content should be easy to understand, if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s just not going to convert very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Your registration requirements are obtrusive<\/strong><br>When it comes to filling out registration forms, less is more. Ask yourself if every field you add is necessary. Remember, the more information you ask your users, the less likely they are going to complete the form and the possibilities of conversion decrease. Your landing page\u2019s goal must be to make it as easy as possible for visitors to convert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Your site is slow to load<\/strong><br>Research from Kissmetrics shows that load times matter when it comes to website performance. Here are some key stat results from their analysis:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c47% of users expect a website to load in two seconds or less. 40% of visitors abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load. Even a one-second to a three-second delay decreases customer satisfaction by about 16%.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your site\u2019s load performance should be your number one priority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Your site is not mobile friendly<\/strong><br>These days it\u2019s critical that your users can navigate your website on mobile devices. Having a mobile-friendly site can double your conversions. Therefore, your webpage should be fast loading and easy to navigate, feel and look great on mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7. Your product\u2019s benefits aren\u2019t clear<\/strong><br>If you don\u2019t share your product\u2019s benefits with your customers clearly on your website and don\u2019t let them know what exactly your product or service is offering them, then you undoubtedly won\u2019t persuade them to convert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. You never give a call-to-action<\/strong><br>Every landing page, product page, blog post, sales page, and so on should end with a convincing and relevant call-to-action that will motivate users to take the initiative. Your customers won\u2019t take action if you don\u2019t encourage them to do so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, what\u2019s even more crucial when it comes to converting more visitors into leads and customers, is making sure that you create a lasting impression for these users to guarantee they\u2019ll be coming back again.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have created what you consider a great website with all the best details in mind: a captivating copy, perfected product images, and overall a professional web design.
