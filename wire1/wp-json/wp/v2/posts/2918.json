And odds are, you&#8217;re one of the thousands of businesses increasing your online marketing budget this year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, you need to make sure you&#8217;re spending your money in the smartest possible way. That means focusing on online marketing strategies with proven track records!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s worth focusing on? Keep reading to learn about five of the best marketing strategies you&#8217;ll want to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Build a Brand<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Audiences are tired of dealing with bland, faceless companies. These days, the most successful businesses are the ones who can tap into the human experience, offering a warmer, more personalized marketing strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/how-to-build-brand-awareness\/\">branding and brand awareness<\/a> can help you diversify your company from the competition while relating to your target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, establish your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/the-art-of-brand-positioning\/\">brand&#8217;s positioning statement<\/a>. This statement identifies your exact audience, your goals, and specifics on how you intend to address your customers&#8217; needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Offer a Cohesive Web Experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fantastic way to enhance your branding is by building a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/web-development\/\">fast, accessible website<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, accessibility means taking a mobile-first approach. Mobile internet growth has <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/mobile-percentage-of-traffic\/\">increased by 504%<\/a> since 2011 and continues to grow in popularity each year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By allowing people to access your website and its content from anywhere, on any device, you&#8217;re opening yourself up for broader appeal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Inform, Don&#8217;t Sell<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned before, today&#8217;s audience is savvier than ever, which means they&#8217;re aware of traditional marketing tactics. In many cases, that awareness leads to active resistance, making online marketing for small businesses even harder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can still reach your audience &#8212; and promote your products or services in the process &#8212; by offering helpful, relatable, and informative content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your content should address your audience&#8217;s pain points as outlined in your positioning statement. Moreover, make sure to include a strong call-to-action (CTA) at the end of each blog and social media post, as well as videos and emails.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Leverage the Latest SEO and PPC Techniques<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve tried your hand at search engine optimization (SEO) and its sister technique, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/learn-the-basics-of-ppc\/\">pay-per-click marketing<\/a> (PPC), you know how overwhelming modern marketing can be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, ignoring SEO and PPC isn&#8217;t an option anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies show that the top result on Google generates <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginewatch.com\/2013\/06\/20\/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study\/\">33% of all traffic<\/a> for a given query. By capitalizing on simple SEO techniques like link building, web accessibility, and content marketing, you&#8217;ll improve your company&#8217;s visibility, and in turn, your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Prioritize Reputation Management<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant online marketing tactics doesn&#8217;t require much change from your business at all!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer reviews are powerful enough that they&#8217;re as effective, if not more, than actual advertising. Therefore, be sure to keep up with your company&#8217;s reputation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Negative reviews can lead to a spiral of lost business. But if you&#8217;re shrewd about your responses and righting any wrongs, you&#8217;ll quickly establish yourself as a trustworthy company that your audience can trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Grow Your Business With These Online Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any of these five online marketing strategies can take your business to the next level. But together, you&#8217;ll have a robust, full-fledged marketing campaign that can help your business skyrocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget, we&#8217;re here to help!
