There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it per se, but is it the best option? Why not opt for a custom website that&#8217;s your own? There are plenty of benefits to custom web design for your business, but many people choose not to take advantage of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe us? Keep reading to learn why custom web design with a web design agency is the way to go.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Custom Designs Look Better<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read only one point, make it this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it. Custom web design looks better. When you pay for custom web design services, you&#8217;re paying for quality and professionals who know how to do things right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be great at using the templates provided by popular website hosts, but they&#8217;re templates. Everyone uses them, so you won&#8217;t have a unique site to call your own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re running a business, this matters. Go custom for a site that looks great.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. You Gain Customer Trust<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider your own customer experience. When you&#8217;re on a website for a business, what do you expect from it?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You expect things to be clear, well-designed, easy to navigate, and full of important information, right? This is where professional website designers come in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your customers to see you as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bizbritain.com\/blog\/importance-of-building-trust-between-you-and-customers\">trustworthy business<\/a>, they need to see that you take your online presence seriously.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Your Branding Stays Consistent&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your branding is everything as a business owner. You want consistency from your promotional materials to your social media, so why should that stop at your website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you choose to get a custom-designed website, you&#8217;re choosing to get designers who want to work with you until you get the perfect site that matches your individual brand. They make your ideas come to life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might think that you&#8217;ll get a better fit by doing it yourself. After all, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/the-art-of-brand-positioning\/\">it&#8217;s your brand<\/a>. Trust us, though. Designers have the experience to amplify your ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. The Website Is More User-Friendly<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A website that&#8217;s difficult to navigate is useless. Consider all of the websites that you&#8217;ve seen where search bars are impossible to find, drop-down menus interfere with each other, and pictures overlap text.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that look professional? Does it improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usability.gov\/what-and-why\/user-experience.html\">user experience<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, of course not. When you hire professionals to put your website together, you can ensure that these problems don&#8217;t happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Scalability Is Key<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want your business to grow and develop over time? You need a website that&#8217;s scalable. It&#8217;s confusing to try to do that on your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your designers know how to handle this. You&#8217;ll continue having a beautiful website as your needs expand and change. Don&#8217;t feel limited by the website that you started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Custom Web Design Is Crucial<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t settle for a DIY website. Hiring a professional for custom web design can get you more customers, improve the user experience (UX), and ultimately support the aesthetic and trust of your brand. Why risk your customers just because you feel like cutting corners?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to build you the website that you deserve. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us for a free consultation<\/a> so we can bring your ideas to life!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you started your business website you probably found one of those sleek templates on an easy-to-use platform to use as a base, right?
