It represents who you are as a business and shows customers what you are all about. In fact, it may be even more important than a physical storefront as research from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business.com\/articles\/7-website-design-mistakes-that-can-hurt-conversion\/\">Standford&#8217;s Web Credibility Study<\/a> reveals 75 percent of consumers judge a business&#8217;s credibility based on the company&#8217;s web design.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your web design is not up to the consumer&#8217;s standards, they will simply disregard it as an illegitimate business and most likely go to the competition.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can avoid this by taking advantage of the latest web design trends. Keep reading to discover the top 3 trends in web design in 2020 that you can implement today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Minimalism<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Minimalism is a growing trend over the past few years that has managed to make a name for itself in the digital world of web design. It involves owning less but, above all else, being happy and content without an abundance of material possessions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minimalism is also expressed through art and creativity &#8211; proving simplicity can have profound effects on where the viewer&#8217;s attention is focused. With less information to distract the viewer, web designers can focus on grabbing the consumer&#8217;s attention and allow them to complete the intended action naturally; for example, clicking on your main call-to-action.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More whitespace on your website is not necessarily a bad thing as previously thought, it can help highlight the information you are trying to portray to the user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Responsive Design<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Responsiveness is one of the most critical trends in web design that is here to stay. Having a responsive design will ensure your website&#8217;s layout, and the content that fills it will load correctly on any device.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of a responsive web design is that all of your web page elements are scaled and will respond to the screen it&#8217;s being viewed on. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.adobe.com\/creative\/files\/2015\/12\/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf\">research from Adobe<\/a>, 38 percent of consumers will abandon the website if the layout doesn&#8217;t load correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a responsive web design will not only please your mobile viewers, it can also give a boost to your technical search engine optimization (SEO). Better SEO practices will increase your visibility on the web and allow consumers to find you easier through search engines like Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Focus on the User Experience<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies have, for the most part, always focused on the consumer. However, online it takes a bit more creativity to get the message across.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way of implementing this through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/web-development\/\">web development<\/a> is by creating trust with the consumer. Trust can be created in a variety of ways like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Providing testimonies<\/li><li>Interacting with users<\/li><li>Providing reputable links<\/li><li>Maintaining quality information<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating trust with your consumers is essential, especially if you are looking to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/branding-services\/\">build a brand<\/a> and continue growing your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Looking to Take Advantage of These Web Design Trends?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These web design trends are helping companies stand out and make a name for themselves on the internet.
