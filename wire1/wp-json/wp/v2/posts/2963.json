For those who are new to digital marketing, it might seem like nothing is working and that the visitors you do get aren&#8217;t doing much for your bottom line.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of things to look at are exit rate and bounce rate. These are terms that refer to the types of behavior your users show when they arrive at your site. We&#8217;re going to take a look at these issues today, giving you an idea of how to improve them when things aren&#8217;t going your way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Improve Your Exit Rate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The website exit rate and bounce rate are often confused because they&#8217;re pretty close to the same thing. An &#8220;exit&#8221; is an instance when the user leaves your site at any point during the session. The &#8220;exit rate&#8221; refers to the percentage of exits there are in the grand scheme of your users&#8217; interactions with your site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if all users arrived at your site and left immediately, your exit rate would be 100%. If they all visited an additional page in their sessions, your exit rate would be 50% because half of the interactions they made were exits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bounce refers to a user who finds your landing page and exits without exploring at all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Do High Rates Reflect?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, you want to have low exits and bounce rates. When looking to reduce your exit rate, it&#8217;s important to note that there&#8217;s always something in the user experience that&#8217;s not quite clicking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user was enticed by your ad or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ryanrobinson\/2019\/09\/18\/social-media-marketing-strategy\/#23223b6b1ff3\">post on social media<\/a>, but something about the page didn&#8217;t pull them in. There are a few principles that you can follow to reliably decrease your bounce and exit rates, though, and they&#8217;re not too complicated to put into action.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adjust Readability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be natural and easy for users to browse through the information on your site. Whether it&#8217;s a product page or a piece of blog content, you never want to display a wall of text for the user.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Space your paragraphs up in groups of two-to-four sentences. Also, make sure there&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/writingcenter.ashford.edu\/writing-clearly-concisely\">a logical progression<\/a> in the information. Further, offer additional resources throughout your content to promote engagement throughout your site.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work with a Graphic Designer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/what-is-ux-design-and-why-is-it-so-important\/\">User experience<\/a> also pertains to the layout and look of your site. If a site looks and feels great, people will be more inclined to engage with it. Not only is it more enjoyable to spend time on a beautiful site, but it gives your business a feeling of credibility.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, include a call to some kind of action. What&#8217;s the point of creating the content if there isn&#8217;t an end goal in mind? Give the user a direction to your products, services, or more of your content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These factors, when done well, will really help to reduce those pesky bounce and exit rates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Need Help with Digital Marketing?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital marketing involves a lot more than your exit rate. There&#8217;s a whole process that goes into attracting the user in the first place. We&#8217;re here to help you through it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us<\/a> for more resources on how to make your marketing campaign as good as it can be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s possible to optimize well, attract a lot of traffic, and still have issues turning that traffic into conversions.
