Other names for it are positioning strategy, brand strategy, and brand positioning statement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main objective behind an effective brand positioning strategy is to identify the differentiating factors of your brand, product or service through pricing, distribution, promotion, packaging, and competition. Your goal should be for your customers to differentiate you from the rest of the markets, by associating your brand with something concrete and attractive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are four essential components to help you refine the art of brand positioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Understand your current positioning in the market<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, take inventory of your current position in the market, this can help you understand the essential aspects of your brand such as your mission statement, value proposition, and core values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, you need to define your target market and analyze how it differs from a wider one. You can get this information through interviews, surveys and questionnaires. A holistic website audit can also provide you with valuable feedback about your internet marketing effectiveness, including actionable advice to improve your site\u2019s business objectives. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, based on your brand\u2019s attributes and the benefits it delivers, divide your market by demographics, lifestyle, purchase behavior and geographic location; this allows you to see the whole picture of your target market and find out what benefits are most important to your ideal customer, while helping you create a brand positioning strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Conduct a competitor analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you completed the previous assessment of your brand and target market, it\u2019s time to analyze your top competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare and contrast your brand with theirs and find out how they are positioning themselves in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s fundamental to take notice of their strengths and weaknesses and research on what they do better and what they do different from your brand. This information will help you to determine your brand\u2019s unique benefits so you can focus your brand strategy around them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Create your brand\u2019s positioning statement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When placing your product or service, you must communicate your brand\u2019s uniqueness in comparison to your main competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are six essential elements of a strong positioning statement:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>An exact demographic description of your target customer<\/li><li>A statement of your customer\u2019s needs<\/li><li>An accurate market definition, including the category your brand is competing in<\/li><li>A statement of the primary difference between your brand and the competitive alternative<\/li><li>Your brand\u2019s promise or the unique benefit that it offers to your target customer<\/li><li>Convincing evidence that your brand delivers on its promise<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>All the elements above give clarity to your brand\u2019s mission on who you are, what you offer and who you are helping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Apply your brand\u2019s positioning statement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After crafting your brand positioning statement, you\u2019re ready to implement it. Set specific, measurable and attainable goals. At the same time, align your positioning statement with your marketing strategy. Moreover, show evidence that your brand delivers on its promise better than its competitors, you can prove it with case studies, reviews and testimonials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just remember a positioning statement captures your brand\u2019s essence. Ultimately, brand positioning is the result of your customer\u2019s experience and perception of what you are and what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you looking to increase sales, brand awareness, grow\/<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/branding-services\/\">establish your brand<\/a>?
