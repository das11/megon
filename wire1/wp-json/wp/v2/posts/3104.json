Some might think of memorable jingles, clever characters, or other brand icons. These all play a part in how to tell a story about a company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In digital marketing, telling a brand story starts with answering a few basic questions. These questions are often critical to your business&#8217;s daily functions and core offerings. You&#8217;ll want to consider the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What&#8217;s your reason for being in business?<\/li><li>How did your business come to be?<\/li><li>Who&#8217;s the face of your company?<\/li><li>What makes your business unique?<\/li><li>Which failures have impacted your company?<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Answering these questions can help write a story showcasing your brand&#8217;s voice. With a clear voice, your messaging becomes clearer. And the more clearly consumers recognize your brand, the more they&#8217;ll trust and purchase from your company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined with the right marketing strategy, these answers provide valuable insight to current and potential customers.
