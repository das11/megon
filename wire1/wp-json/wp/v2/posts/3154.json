The Essential Guide for Company Branding"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Branding is everything. The way your current and prospective customers view your company&#8217;s brand has an enormous impact on your bottom line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Company branding is essential, to say the least. Done the wrong way, it could ruin your business. Done right, it could spur your business to new heights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get the go-to guide for ideas, tips, and more by reading on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Best In Company Branding<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/branding-services\/\">Branding<\/a> is related to everything your company does, in some way. Whether your business is small, large, B2B, or retail, it needs to maximize the power of its brand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your brand is your promise to your customer. It sets your product apart from the pack. It also tells your customers what to expect from your services and products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your brand starts with your logo. Your promotional items, packaging, and website materials should all integrate your logo to communicate your brand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, define your brand by answering some key questions. What&#8217;s your company&#8217;s mission? What is the look and feel you want? What do you want your brand to convey?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the features and benefits of your services or products? What qualities do you want customers to associate with your brand?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is your brand&#8217;s strategy. This is how, when, where, what, and to whom you plan on delivering and communicating your brand messages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to decide where to advertise, what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/d\/distribution-channel.asp#:~:text=A%20distribution%20channel%20represents%20a,sells%20directly%20to%20the%20consumer.\">distribution channels<\/a> to use, and how you communicate verbally and visually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Your Highly Valuable Brand<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategic branding builds brand equity. That&#8217;s the value added to your company&#8217;s services or products that lets you charge more for your brand than unbranded, identical products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of Coca-Cola, for example, which can charge more than a generic brand because of its brand equity. Such equity&#8217;s added value often comes in the form of emotional attachment or perceived quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You achieve <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/propointgraphics\/2017\/07\/08\/building-brand-equity\/?sh=6158cf516e8f\">brand equity<\/a> by spreading the word about your business. Choose a logo and put it everywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrate your brand into the way you answer the phone, your email signature, what you or your salespeople wear on sales calls, and more. Create a tagline that concisely captures your brand&#8217;s essence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Develop a company voice that reflects your brand in all written communication and is used in all materials&#8217; visual imagery. Make templates and brand standards for your marketing materials that feature the same logo placement, color scheme, feel, and look throughout.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay true to your brand. You won&#8217;t keep customers and they won&#8217;t refer you if your results don&#8217;t fulfill your brand&#8217;s promises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Powerful Brand<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have cohesive company branding already, get started on it today. It&#8217;s never too late (or too soon) to build a highly marketable, powerful brand for your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brand isn&#8217;t just a logo. It&#8217;s the feeling and memories of excellence that you&#8217;ll leave in your customers.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/contact-us\/\">Contact us today<\/a> and let our professionals build an unmatched brand for your company.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Branding is everything.
