Neglecting your brand, however, can leave prospective clients confused about who you are and what you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you struggling to improve your online branding and keep it consistent? Here are five branding hacks that can help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tips, you can build a brand that represents your business <em>and<\/em> boosts sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get started with these five tips for building a brand online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Consider Your Goals<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you build your visual brand, you need to consider your business goals. Make sure these goals are SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, results-driven, timely). For example, you might want to:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increase sales for Product X by the end of the third quarter<\/li><li>Boost website visitors by 20% by the end of the year<\/li><li>Increase Facebook social media followers by 15% this year<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know your goals, you can start building an online brand that helps accomplish each one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Know Your Audience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your brand is meant to help you connect with your ideal customers. For that to happen, you need to know everything you can about your target audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use demographics like age, gender, location, and household income to separate your audience into personas. Think about their buying behaviors, interests, and the problems they face daily, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know more about your audience, you can use online branding to appeal to their needs and interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Visualize Your Value<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets your business apart from everyone else&#8217;s? Why should customers choose your business first?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your unique value will help you attract customers. While you&#8217;re building a brand online, it&#8217;s important to keep that value in mind. You&#8217;ll use that value as the heart of your brand as you differentiate yourself in the marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Bring Your Brand to Life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>About <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/tracy-leigh-hazzard\/boost-profit-with-constant-brand-consistency.html\">95% of businesses<\/a> have branding guidelines. However, only a fourth actually enforce those guidelines. Your brand guidelines should include your:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Font style<\/li><li>Font size<\/li><li>Color scheme<\/li><li>Logo<\/li><li>Photography and imagery style<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, your brand isn&#8217;t only visual. It also includes your tone, voice, and brand&#8217;s personality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of your brand as a real person. How would they talk, act, and look? Bring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/branding-services\/\">your brand to life<\/a> to help your customers visualize your business the same way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Keep It Consistent<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/LeanBack1\/contentmarketingstudy\">85% of marketers<\/a> say their main reason for creating content brand awareness and positive perceptions of the company.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you use these online branding tips and develop your brand guidelines, it&#8217;s important to keep your brand consistent. Your brand should appear the same across every piece of marketing materials you use. That includes print materials like your business cards and flyers alongside <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dgstudio.com\/internet-marketing\/\">your PPC ads<\/a> and website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your brand looks different online, you might risk confusing customers. They could even think you&#8217;re an entirely different business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping your brand consistent on and offline will help boost brand awareness and recognition instead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improve Your Image<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Improve your image and stand out from the crowd.
