<p>In today&#8217;s world, part of owning a business is having <a href="https://www.thehartford.com/business-insurance/strategy/building-website/10-reasons-need-website">a good website</a>. Customers expect a good user experience, and if they find your site hard to navigate, they aren&#8217;t likely to come back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could have the best products, the cheapest prices, and the best service, but a bad website can wipe that all away. Consider your website as an online storefront. You need to put your best foot forward.</p>



<p>If you think that you need to improve user experience, we&#8217;re here to help. Keep reading to learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Responsive Web Design</strong></h2>



<p>Implementing good responsive web design is a great way to ensure that you have a user-friendly website. This web design style attempts to increase website speed and minimize scrolling and clicking, and it works across all devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t ignore the importance of your mobile website. What seems responsible on a desktop may be clunky or unreadable on a phone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Easy Social Media Access</strong></h2>



<p>If your brand has a strong social media presence (and it should), make sure that your guests have easy access to your platforms. Remember, your social media and your other forms of <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">digital marketing</a> should work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most popular way of doing this is to put easy-to-see icons that match each social media site or app on the front page of your site (or on your contact page). This way, people don&#8217;t have to search.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Clean Navigation</strong></h2>



<p>Have you ever been attempting to navigate a site just to discover that it&#8217;s impossible to find (or click) what you&#8217;re looking for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an easy mistake that you might not notice if you never run tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure that all of your important pages are accessible from your main page. It&#8217;s helpful to include a directory at the bottom as well as a navigation bar or drop-down menu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have drop-down menus, make sure that they are functional. Many people make the mistake of making the menus too sensitive, making it difficult to click on anything without making the menu disappear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will frustrate your guests and take them elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Frequent Feedback&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The best way to make sure that you&#8217;re providing the best user experience, check in with your users and keep track of your visitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feedback isn&#8217;t always verbal. You can survey visitors to ask them what they like and dislike, but you can also track <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp">website metrics</a> to see if what you&#8217;re doing is working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll be able to see how many people are visiting your website, how long they&#8217;re staying, and if you have a good conversion rate.</p>



<h2><strong>Improve User Experience Today</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to improve user experience for your website, it&#8217;s time for a redesign. Make sure that you create a website that&#8217;s responsive and easy to navigate, and that visitors can go from your site to your social platforms with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do routine check-ins to see how you&#8217;re doing and watch your business grow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you started your business website you probably found one of those sleek templates on an easy-to-use platform to use as a base, right?</p>



<p>This is common for new business owners. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it per se, but is it the best option? Why not opt for a custom website that&#8217;s your own? There are plenty of benefits to custom web design for your business, but many people choose not to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t believe us? Keep reading to learn why custom web design with a web design agency is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>1. Custom Designs Look Better</h2>



<p>If you read only one point, make it this one.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it. Custom web design looks better. When you pay for custom web design services, you&#8217;re paying for quality and professionals who know how to do things right.</p>



<p>You might be great at using the templates provided by popular website hosts, but they&#8217;re templates. Everyone uses them, so you won&#8217;t have a unique site to call your own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re running a business, this matters. Go custom for a site that looks great.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. You Gain Customer Trust</h2>



<p>Consider your own customer experience. When you&#8217;re on a website for a business, what do you expect from it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You expect things to be clear, well-designed, easy to navigate, and full of important information, right? This is where professional website designers come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want your customers to see you as a <a href="https://www.bizbritain.com/blog/importance-of-building-trust-between-you-and-customers">trustworthy business</a>, they need to see that you take your online presence seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. Your Branding Stays Consistent&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your branding is everything as a business owner. You want consistency from your promotional materials to your social media, so why should that stop at your website?</p>



<p>When you choose to get a custom-designed website, you&#8217;re choosing to get designers who want to work with you until you get the perfect site that matches your individual brand. They make your ideas come to life.</p>



<p>You might think that you&#8217;ll get a better fit by doing it yourself. After all, <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/the-art-of-brand-positioning/">it&#8217;s your brand</a>. Trust us, though. Designers have the experience to amplify your ideas.</p>



<h2>4. The Website Is More User-Friendly</h2>



<p>A website that&#8217;s difficult to navigate is useless. Consider all of the websites that you&#8217;ve seen where search bars are impossible to find, drop-down menus interfere with each other, and pictures overlap text.</p>



<p>Does that look professional? Does it improve your <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html">user experience</a>?</p>



<p>No, of course not. When you hire professionals to put your website together, you can ensure that these problems don&#8217;t happen.</p>



<h2>5. Scalability Is Key</h2>



<p>Do you want your business to grow and develop over time? You need a website that&#8217;s scalable. It&#8217;s confusing to try to do that on your own.</p>



<p>Your designers know how to handle this. You&#8217;ll continue having a beautiful website as your needs expand and change. Don&#8217;t feel limited by the website that you started.</p>



<h2>Custom Web Design Is Crucial</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t settle for a DIY website. Hiring a professional for custom web design can get you more customers, improve the user experience (UX), and ultimately support the aesthetic and trust of your brand. Why risk your customers just because you feel like cutting corners?</p>

<p>So you have an idea for your business, but you haven&#8217;t launched your website yet. You might think that choosing a domain name will be an easy and straightforward process, but choosing the wrong name can have huge consequences. You don&#8217;t want your brand to suffer because you chose an <a href="https://conflict-news.com/domain-names/">unfortunate domain name</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re here to help you avoid that mistake. We&#8217;ll teach you how to choose a domain name for your business that fits your brand.</p>



<p>Here are five key tips you need to know before choosing your domain name.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Choose .Com Domains</strong></h2>



<p>When choosing a domain name, you have several options for top-level domains (TLDs). TLDs include .com, .org, .biz, .net, .edu and so on. Of course, .com domains continue to remain <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/com-vs-net-vs-us-3467135">one of the most popular</a> options.</p>



<p>When you have the option, choose a .com TLD. However, if that domain isn&#8217;t available, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. You can <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-domain-extensions-com-not-available/132321/">get creative</a> with your domain name, such as rearranging the words or choosing another relevant TLD such as .blog or .store instead.</p>



<h2><strong>2. It Doesn&#8217;t Have to Match Your Business Name</strong></h2>



<p>Your domain doesn&#8217;t have to be word-for-word the same as your business name. For example, if you have a longer business name, you might not want every word in your domain. Instead, you could consider shortening the domain to an acronym.</p>



<p>In some instances, you may want to add location information. If you&#8217;re a local plumber in North Carolina and your target customers are local, you might want to add NC to the domain.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Think About SEO</strong></h2>



<p>SEO plays a <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-big-benefits-of-seo-for-your-business/">huge part</a> in targeting traffic and raising brand awareness. Many businesses will use keywords during a domain name registration. Keywords tell visitors what to expect from your business and also that you specialize in that area.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unsure which keywords to target or whether it might make your domain too long, consult with a digital marketing agency that specializes in <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">internet marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development</a>. That way, you can work together toward your goals and choose the right domain name for your business.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Keep It Short</strong></h2>



<p>Long, complicated domains won&#8217;t do your business any favors. Names that are tricky to remember aren&#8217;t going to stick in your customers&#8217; minds.</p>



<p>The ideal length for a website domain is somewhere between 6-14 characters. The shorter, the better in most cases. If it&#8217;s short, sweet, easy to remember, and reflects your brand, you&#8217;ve got a winner.</p>



<h2><strong>5. It Reflects Your Brand</strong></h2>



<p>Lastly, it&#8217;s important to remember that this domain will reflect your brand. Make sure the tone reflects your business. For example, it could be funny, clever, or professional sounding, but it should reflect the tone of your brand.</p>



<p>Your domain is one of the first impressions people have of your business. How do you want them to perceive you? Keep this question in mind when going through your options.</p>



<h2><strong>Need Help Choosing a Domain Name?</strong></h2>



<p>As you can see, a lot of thought should go into your domain name. If you&#8217;re not sure where to start or if you need help choosing a domain name for your brand, we can help.</p>

<p>For any business to succeed, it needs to compete in the modern market. However, almost all business is done online now, and so it doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of business you have — you need a website. To get one, you need to know whether to invest in web design vs web development.</p>



<p>They are not the same — one is about organizing information and the other is about organizing servers. Investing in the wrong one can cost your business more than just money. Keep reading below to learn more about which service to invest in, and how it can help your business!</p>



<h2><strong>Web Design vs Web Development: Know the Difference</strong></h2>



<p>There are several differences between web design and <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development</a>, but they&#8217;re both important. They work together to build an excellent website that attracts audiences and impresses users.</p>



<p>Web designers are skilled in design and have studied more than just technology. They know how to organize information so that users can access it easily while impressing them with your brand. A good web designer will make a website that people want to go to and explore.</p>



<p>Web developers, on the other hand, work behind the scenes on your website. They create the actual infrastructure of web pages that make your website able to exist in the first place. People hire them if they don&#8217;t want to depend on third parties for their website and want to host it themselves.</p>



<h3><strong>Web Designers Aren&#8217;t as Technical as Web Developers</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to make a website for your business, you probably want to hire a web designer. Although they do not build the actual infrastructure of websites, most of the time you don&#8217;t need it. There are third party options available for business owners who don&#8217;t want to think about the technical details of web development.</p>



<p>Instead, it&#8217;s better to invest in the actual organization of your business&#8217;s information and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#783217467645">design of your website</a>. You should invest in making sure that your users can access information about you, since you don&#8217;t need to worry about hosting it. And for that, you want to hire a web designer.</p>



<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t Go It Alone — Hire Help</strong></h2>



<p>Even if you just put out <a href="https://medium.com/collabos/6-steps-to-successfully-hiring-your-first-freelancer-3004f8bb38e1">advertisements for freelancers</a>, it&#8217;s important that you hire a web designer before building a website. Most people think they can simply use a platform to build their website, but it&#8217;s not that simple. Just because you have the tools to build a website doesn&#8217;t mean you know how to use them.</p>



<p>Web designers have skills in parts of websites that most people never realize even exist. Getting those things wrong will cost your business revenue since people know when the colors on your web page are off if an animation is broken. They simply won&#8217;t want to use it.</p>



<h2><strong>Building a Website is an Investment</strong></h2>



<p>Knowing whether you should invest in web design vs web development is just the first step. After deciding on which kind of professional to hire, you need to actually create a website for your company. It&#8217;s not easy, and any good business leader would say that it&#8217;s better to do so.</p>

<p>The design of your website can be thought of as your storefront. It represents who you are as a business and shows customers what you are all about. In fact, it may be even more important than a physical storefront as research from <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/7-website-design-mistakes-that-can-hurt-conversion/">Standford&#8217;s Web Credibility Study</a> reveals 75 percent of consumers judge a business&#8217;s credibility based on the company&#8217;s web design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your web design is not up to the consumer&#8217;s standards, they will simply disregard it as an illegitimate business and most likely go to the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can avoid this by taking advantage of the latest web design trends. Keep reading to discover the top 3 trends in web design in 2020 that you can implement today.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Minimalism</strong></h2>



<p>Minimalism is a growing trend over the past few years that has managed to make a name for itself in the digital world of web design. It involves owning less but, above all else, being happy and content without an abundance of material possessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Minimalism is also expressed through art and creativity &#8211; proving simplicity can have profound effects on where the viewer&#8217;s attention is focused. With less information to distract the viewer, web designers can focus on grabbing the consumer&#8217;s attention and allow them to complete the intended action naturally; for example, clicking on your main call-to-action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More whitespace on your website is not necessarily a bad thing as previously thought, it can help highlight the information you are trying to portray to the user.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Responsive Design</strong></h2>



<p>Responsiveness is one of the most critical trends in web design that is here to stay. Having a responsive design will ensure your website&#8217;s layout, and the content that fills it will load correctly on any device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea of a responsive web design is that all of your web page elements are scaled and will respond to the screen it&#8217;s being viewed on. According to <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf">research from Adobe</a>, 38 percent of consumers will abandon the website if the layout doesn&#8217;t load correctly.</p>



<p>Having a responsive web design will not only please your mobile viewers, it can also give a boost to your technical search engine optimization (SEO). Better SEO practices will increase your visibility on the web and allow consumers to find you easier through search engines like Google.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Focus on the User Experience</strong></h2>



<p>Companies have, for the most part, always focused on the consumer. However, online it takes a bit more creativity to get the message across.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way of implementing this through <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development</a> is by creating trust with the consumer. Trust can be created in a variety of ways like:</p>



<ul><li>Providing testimonies</li><li>Interacting with users</li><li>Providing reputable links</li><li>Maintaining quality information</li></ul>



<p>Creating trust with your consumers is essential, especially if you are looking to <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/branding-services/">build a brand</a> and continue growing your business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Looking to Take Advantage of These Web Design Trends?</strong></h2>



<p>These web design trends are helping companies stand out and make a name for themselves on the internet. It&#8217;s more critical than ever to have an online presence as consumers are going online at record-breaking amounts. Taking advantage of these website trends can help give your business the competitive advantage it needs to stay ahead of the competition. </p>

<p>In the United States alone, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html">26% of adults</a> have a disability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing the accessibility in the world around us is important. This can mean installing more wheelchair ramps in businesses, incorporating closed captions on videos, and providing image descriptions on websites.</p>



<p>Because our smartphones and computers are a major part of our daily routine, creating an accessible virtual world is crucial. There are many things a business or blogger can include on their site to be more inclusive, including the use of alt text.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure to keep reading below to discover what alt text is and why you should use it! It will create a world of difference for your site&#8217;s viewers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What Is Alt Text?</strong></h2>



<p>Alt text is a text description of visual elements. These visual elements can include photographs, data charts, and different icons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When utilizing typed descriptions, individuals may use text to speech tools to better understand the visual elements you&#8217;ve included on your site. Individuals who use text to speech features include those who are blind, have difficulty seeing, or students who prefer auditory learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Providing alt text for accessible design is important, but it&#8217;s also important to know how to write alt text. The text should be concise yet meaningful for the readers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Do I Write Alt Text?</strong></h2>



<p>There are some dos and don&#8217;ts of alt text you should follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you create alt text for images, try to stick to around 100 words. Remain concise while providing a sufficient description.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, alt text is a literal description of the image and not the same thing as a caption. A caption is usually something conceptual or witty. An example of alt text is, &#8220;Dog sits beside a large tree.&#8221;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t describe <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/">decorative imagery</a>, such as floral design elements, on the page. This can confuse the viewer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Does It Affect SEO Results?</strong></h2>



<p>Not only does alt text create a more accessible design, but it can also help SEO results. Images become searchable when alt text is provided.</p>



<p>Many people use Google to perform image searches. You can construct your alt text in a way that increases accessibility and search engine visibility. For example, a blind individual may want to know what color the car is in a photo, but your image could also pop up for someone searching for a &#8216;green car.’</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget to incorporate <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-seo-tips-to-help-you-rank-better/">other SEO tips</a> to boost your website traffic!</p>



<h2><strong>Increase Accessibility and Boost Your Site&#8217;s Traffic with Alt Text</strong></h2>



<p>Every day we should be moving towards a more accessible world for everyone! A great way to do this is the use of alt text on your site. Not only does it create more accessibility, but it also makes your images searchable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Individuals who are blind or have difficulty seeing use tools such as text to speech readers while exploring a virtual landscape. Write concise, meaningful descriptions for your site&#8217;s images to make your site more inclusive.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">50 percent</a> of all web traffic is conducted on mobile phones.</p>



<p>With the increase in mobile phones, ensuring your website is responsive on mobile devices is key. Phone compatibility is increasingly important with the large jump in consumer reliance on phones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is why you need a mobile-friendly website:</p>

<h2><strong>2. Improved User Experience</strong></h2>



<p>Visibility is not the only important factor when aiming to improve user experience. A website that is compatible with mobile phones makes your site readily available to potential customers.</p>

Creating a great, simple experience for mobile users will <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/how-to-drastically-reduce-your-websites-exit-rate/">increase engagement</a> and traffic on your site.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Engaged Google Ranking</strong></h2>



<p>Google algorithms favor mobile-friendly websites. In combination with <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-seo-tips-to-help-you-rank-better/">strong SEO</a>, mobile-friendly websites give you a top-rank on Google, allowing you to increase your company&#8217;s brand awareness.</p>



<p>Mobile-friendly sites, found through Google, increase the chances that users will turn into customers. Users seek out and prefer to engage with sites that are compatible with mobile phones.</p>



<p>Create a comprehensive marketing approach that uses Google algorithms to your advantage.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Increased Sales</strong></h2>

<p>It&#8217;s possible to optimize well, attract a lot of traffic, and still have issues turning that traffic into conversions. For those who are new to digital marketing, it might seem like nothing is working and that the visitors you do get aren&#8217;t doing much for your bottom line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of things to look at are exit rate and bounce rate. These are terms that refer to the types of behavior your users show when they arrive at your site. We&#8217;re going to take a look at these issues today, giving you an idea of how to improve them when things aren&#8217;t going your way.</p>



<h2>How to Improve Your Exit Rate</h2>



<p>The website exit rate and bounce rate are often confused because they&#8217;re pretty close to the same thing. An &#8220;exit&#8221; is an instance when the user leaves your site at any point during the session. The &#8220;exit rate&#8221; refers to the percentage of exits there are in the grand scheme of your users&#8217; interactions with your site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if all users arrived at your site and left immediately, your exit rate would be 100%. If they all visited an additional page in their sessions, your exit rate would be 50% because half of the interactions they made were exits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A bounce refers to a user who finds your landing page and exits without exploring at all.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What Do High Rates Reflect?</h3>



<p>Naturally, you want to have low exits and bounce rates. When looking to reduce your exit rate, it&#8217;s important to note that there&#8217;s always something in the user experience that&#8217;s not quite clicking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The user was enticed by your ad or a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanrobinson/2019/09/18/social-media-marketing-strategy/#23223b6b1ff3">post on social media</a>, but something about the page didn&#8217;t pull them in. There are a few principles that you can follow to reliably decrease your bounce and exit rates, though, and they&#8217;re not too complicated to put into action.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Adjust Readability</h3>



<p>It should be natural and easy for users to browse through the information on your site. Whether it&#8217;s a product page or a piece of blog content, you never want to display a wall of text for the user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Space your paragraphs up in groups of two-to-four sentences. Also, make sure there&#8217;s <a href="https://writingcenter.ashford.edu/writing-clearly-concisely">a logical progression</a> in the information. Further, offer additional resources throughout your content to promote engagement throughout your site.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Work with a Graphic Designer</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/what-is-ux-design-and-why-is-it-so-important/">User experience</a> also pertains to the layout and look of your site. If a site looks and feels great, people will be more inclined to engage with it. Not only is it more enjoyable to spend time on a beautiful site, but it gives your business a feeling of credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, include a call to some kind of action. What&#8217;s the point of creating the content if there isn&#8217;t an end goal in mind? Give the user a direction to your products, services, or more of your content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These factors, when done well, will really help to reduce those pesky bounce and exit rates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Need Help with Digital Marketing?</h2>



<p>Digital marketing involves a lot more than your exit rate. There&#8217;s a whole process that goes into attracting the user in the first place. We&#8217;re here to help you through it.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/how-many-websites-are-there/">more than a billion websites</a> out there and you may have noticed a trend in recent years that many of those websites are starting to look the same.</p>



<p>It’s left many wondering how to stand out in the crowd. Often the answer is to invest in high quality and professional web development for your business.</p>



<p>What can professional web development services do for you? These phenomenal benefits illustrate the difference the right website development team can make.</p>



<h2>Look More Like Yourself and Less Like Your Competitors</h2>



<p>As noted, many of the billions of websites out there look a lot alike. That’s thanks to the prevalence of website templates. Businesses can buy these ready-made designs and use them with relatively little fuss.</p>



<p>This may seem like an affordable solution at first. But it&#8217;s a bit of a problem when you and your competitors all look the same. Your customers might not be able to tell you apart.</p>



<p>Most templates also have limited opportunities for customization. That may mean you can’t brand your website the way you want to. In an era where brand consistency is key, you’ll likely need custom design.</p>



<p>The right web development company can help you find a unique look that makes you stand out in the crowd.</p>



<h2>Stay Ahead of the Curve with the Right Technology</h2>



<p>When you work with a web design and development company, you’ll also get the latest web technologies. You can incorporate better security or make your customer’s website experience even easier.</p>



<p>Better yet, your web development partner will help you stay ahead of the curve. They can keep your website up to date, so you’ll always be one step ahead of your competitors.</p>



<h2>Professional Web Development Is Better for Your Customers</h2>



<p>A professional web development service also delivers <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/what-is-ux-design-and-why-is-it-so-important/">a better user experience</a> for your customers. For example, using the latest technology on an ecommerce site makes checking out both secure and simple.</p>



<p>Professional design also makes the site easier to navigate. Your customers can find what they want instantly. Your design team must be aware of the latest trends, so your website always looks up-to-date and modern.</p>



<p>The result will be a better impression for visitors to your website.</p>



<h2>Professional Web Design and Development Improves Marketing</h2>



<p>As we’ve discussed, professional web design and development improves your customer’s experience. But what does that have to do with your marketing?</p>



<p>The increased customizability and better technology can also boost your marketing initiatives. You may have more <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-seo-tips-to-help-you-rank-better/">control over SEO</a> factors, which could propel you to the top rank in Google searches.</p>



<p>A lighter design and optimized images mean your users are more satisfied. In turn, your SEO improves.</p>



<h2>Work Toward a Better Bottom Line</h2>



<p>Increased customer satisfaction and better SEO can help you boost website revenue. Working with a professional web development team can also save you time and money.</p>



<p>In turn, your bottom line will look even healthier.</p>



<h2>Your Website Deserves the Best</h2>



<p>Professional web development has some amazing benefits for your business. In a more competitive market, you need every advantage you can get.</p>

<p>Great design can make a massive impact on the number of customers who engage with your website. However, if your website is all style and no substance, your potential customers may be clicking away from your site moments later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a pretty website is nice, it won&#8217;t help your online business grow without good UX. UX design is the key to having a website that looks good and converts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is UX design, and why does it matter? Good question. Read on to learn more about UX and how it can help your business thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is UX Design?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Understanding your customers&#8217; needs is the first rule of marketing. Once you know what your customer needs, the next step is to ensure those needs are met in every stage of working with you.</p>



<p>A customer visits your website to learn more about your business, choose which service is right for them, buy products, and more. No matter what you use your website for, making sure that it&#8217;s easy to use is vital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UX stands for user experience. When you design with UX in mind, you&#8217;re creating a website that responds to your customers&#8217; needs as efficiently as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/good-ux-examples/">Good UX design</a> makes interacting with your website enjoyable. Creating a website with intuitive navigation, engaging content, and clear calls to action are all part of a positive user experience.</p>



<p>While UX design is frequently referencing websites, it also applies to marketing collateral, mobile apps, online forms, and even physical product design. A UX designer researches user behavior to continually iterate and provide an experience that users expect. That may mean UX team members are testing web pages, issuing surveys, and empathizing with your customer to improve SEO rankings, PPC campaigns, branding, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why is UX Important for Small Businesses?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As a small business, you develop close relationships with your customers. Ensuring that your customer feels understood, seen, and cared for makes UX design for small businesses a must.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competing with big brands is easier when small brands focus on their strengths. One of those strengths is having closer proximity and intimacy with your <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/why-knowing-your-target-audience-is-important/">target audience</a>. Even just by living and working in the same area, you have a better idea of what your clients look for in a product or service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a better understanding of your customer personas, you can define a user experience that incorporates multiple aspects of your business. For example, you may look at your analytics data and see that people are bouncing from your website after only viewing one page. That may lead you to focus on speeding up your site for better SEO performance or creating a landing page that aligns with PPC campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many ways <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/ux-and-cro/the-dos-and-donts-of-ux-design-for-small-business/">UX strategies</a> can help your business save money without major changes. Working with a marketing team that prioritizes UX can help you deliver an experience that turns leads to customers!</p>



<h2><strong>Designing With the User in Mind</strong></h2>



<p>Creating <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">marketing campaigns</a> and a website that meet your client where they are is the best way to attract new clients. However, lots of small business owners have no clue where to start.</p>
