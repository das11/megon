<p>As of 2021 a study showed that <a href="https://financesonline.com/digital-marketing-statistics/">36% of companies</a> were looking to implement some sort of digital marketing plan into their internal business procedures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re reading this, we understand that you might be looking into creating a digital marketing plan that will push your company in the right direction.</p>



<p>Below, we&#8217;re going to share a brief guide that will give you information you need when it comes to <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/how-to-create-a-marketing-campaign/">digital campaigns</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Set Your Goals</strong></h2>



<p>Whenever you create any type of plan for your company, the first thing you need to do is set your goals. Without setting your goals, how will you know what your team is working to achieve?</p>



<p>Setting goals will help you structure the rest of your plan accordingly to ensure that the goals are met in a timely manner. Once you set goals, it will also be easier to monitor the progress that you&#8217;re making towards the goals.</p>



<h2><strong>Use Automation</strong></h2>



<p>There are several ways that you can incorporate media automation into your digital marketing plan in a useful way. If you&#8217;re looking to run an email marketing campaign, automation can help you to send out mass emails at one time or even allow you to set up drip campaigns.</p>



<p>Ensure that your staff is up to date on the latest software and technologies that are needed to help marketing automation run efficiently.</p>



<h2><strong>Review Marketing Channels</strong></h2>



<p>There are several marketing channels that are at the fingertips of your business. You need to take time to think about the various channels that you&#8217;re using, such as email marketing, paid advertising, social media, etc.</p>



<p>While some of them might be working for you currently, after you&#8217;ve done the review, you may notice that some of these channels are no longer going to serve you the way that you need them to.</p>



<p>Reviewing marketing channels is essential when it comes to <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">internet marketing</a> strategies your company uses.</p>



<h2><strong>Increase Customer Accessibility</strong></h2>



<p>When we say increase customer accessibility, we mean making it easy for customers to contact you. This means adding easy to find contact information to your website and other social media channels. Also be sure to think about other avenues where you customers would like to reach you, live chats, DMs, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If clients aren&#8217;t able to reach you, it&#8217;s likely that they will look for a company that offers them the services that your company does. Not having the right contact information will not help you when it comes to customer retention.</p>



<h2><strong>Digital Marketing Plan: The Best Way to Advertise Your Brands Services</strong></h2>



<p>All businesses should have some sort of digital marketing plan before they move forward with their next marketing campaign. You should always make the goals that you and your team need to reach known.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also helpful to keep your contact information updated for clients to reach you. If you need help in the area of digital marketing, <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/contact-us/">contact DG Studio</a>.</p>



<p>We know how to help your company get a foot up over the competition when it comes to all things marketing.</p>

<p>Getting your digital marketing campaign under wraps is a tricky thing to do. It&#8217;s important to know your options, understand the terminology, and get how all of the pieces work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PPC is a huge piece of the puzzle, and we&#8217;re going to help you understand it today. We&#8217;ll go over some PPC tips, giving you the scoop on how paid advertisements work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is PPC?</p>



<h2><strong>What is PPC?</strong></h2>



<p>PPC stands for &#8220;pay-per-click.&#8221; It&#8217;s a form of digital advertising that allows businesses to spread content far and wide without having to pay too much.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The name comes from the fact that you&#8217;re charged whenever your advertisement is engaged with or &#8220;clicked&#8221; on. So, you can display your content for thousands of people for a cost based on the number of people who interact with your ad.</p>



<p>When people do click, you pay for precisely what you pay for. Pricing is one of the main benefits of PPC, but the good stuff doesn&#8217;t stop there.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What are Paid Ads?</strong></h3>



<p>The concept of &#8220;paid ads&#8221; is pretty simple. You just pay for an advertisement that goes up on search engines or social media, typically you would see results with paid ads faster than with <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/7-ways-seo-could-benefit-your-business/">an SEO campaign</a> that would have you rise up organically over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, the PPC ads we&#8217;re describing are what are commonly seen as &#8220;sponsored posts&#8221; or advertisements on your social media feeds. Look a little closer and you&#8217;ll see that they&#8217;re in your Google searches as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beautiful thing here is that businesses and individuals can display their content for people who might <em>actually</em> be interested in it. Have you noticed that the ads you get are pretty often interesting?</p>



<p>This is because social media and search engines take in a lot of your personal information, and that information is used to target you for ads. It seems a little spooky, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-personal-data-collection/">it might be</a>, but it&#8217;s nice to be free from a bunch of advertisements that have nothing to do with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re going to get ads, why not have them be for things that you&#8217;re interested in? This allows you to achieve a lot more success as an advertiser as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></h3>



<p>The process starts with a clear target audience. You can use keyword research and the data from social media sites to curate your advertisement and send it out to a <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15229-reach-your-target-audience.html">very specific group</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sending out numerous ads is beneficial because you can cross-reference statistics on each to find out what works the best. After some time, you&#8217;ll know what works and what doesn&#8217;t, allowing you to create effective ads on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to find success in paid advertisements is to work with professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Need Some Help with Your Digital Marketing?</strong></h2>

<p>Building a successful SEO strategy isn&#8217;t something that happens overnight.</p>



<p>You need to develop a strong understanding of SEO and other digital marketing practices if you&#8217;re going to get your website on the first page of Google. Between blogging, social media, and SEO, it can be a full-time job just to maintain a website, let alone bring in enough traffic to get to the top of the SERPs (Search Engine Result Pages).</p>



<p>In this post, we&#8217;re going to talk about SEO and authority so that you can figure out how to get on the first page of Google. You&#8217;ll quickly see that SEO and blogging are more important to the online success of your business than you may have thought.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How to Get On the First Page of Google?</strong></h2>



<p>Getting on the first page of Google is <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/7-ways-seo-could-benefit-your-business/">what all businesses strive for</a>. It&#8217;s not easy to do, however, so follow these tips as you get started.</p>



<h3><strong>Long-Tail Keywords</strong></h3>



<p>The Google search algorithm is dominated by long-tail keywords these days. In the past, the right keywords were short phrases that you could slide into your blogs to get more hits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long-tail keywords have come along, due in part to voice search. Although they have a lower search volume, the conversion rate is much higher. Utilize these, capitalize on user search intent to drive traffic to your site, make more conversions, and you could possibly end up on the first page of Google.</p>



<h3><strong>Blog Away</strong></h3>



<p>Blogging is as important as it&#8217;s ever been. The problem with prioritizing long-tail keywords is that they&#8217;re much harder to integrate into your posts. Stuffing them in will look unnatural and put off your readers.</p>



<p>To combat this, you need to blog more frequently to make use of more long-tail keywords, <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/12-ways-to-earn-money-authority-by-blogging.html">establish your authority</a> in the field, and beat out your competitors to the top of Google. Writing new posts every 1-2 days is a must if you&#8217;re going to reach these heights.</p>



<h3><strong>Your Site</strong></h3>



<p>Having a functional website has always been important, but it&#8217;s more complicated now than it&#8217;s ever been. We have more devices, which gives you more opportunity for promotion, but also more responsibility when it comes to web design and maintenance.</p>



<p>For instance, having a really nice mobile site is as important as your desktop site. More people are performing searches on their phones, so if you&#8217;re going to rank at the top of the Google SERPs, you&#8217;d better have a site that works well on phones and tablets.</p>



<p>Not only should it look nice and work well, but it&#8217;s also got to be fast. You can find all sorts of <a href="https://unbounce.com/landing-pages/7-page-speed-stats-for-marketers/">daunting statistics</a> that shed some light on customer behavior. You&#8217;ve only got a few seconds to grab people&#8217;s attention, so you&#8217;d better seize it with a quick site.</p>



<h2><strong>Learn SEO and Watch Your Business Flourish</strong></h2>

<p>In today&#8217;s world, part of owning a business is having <a href="https://www.thehartford.com/business-insurance/strategy/building-website/10-reasons-need-website">a good website</a>. Customers expect a good user experience, and if they find your site hard to navigate, they aren&#8217;t likely to come back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could have the best products, the cheapest prices, and the best service, but a bad website can wipe that all away. Consider your website as an online storefront. You need to put your best foot forward.</p>



<p>If you think that you need to improve user experience, we&#8217;re here to help. Keep reading to learn more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Responsive Web Design</strong></h2>



<p>Implementing good responsive web design is a great way to ensure that you have a user-friendly website. This web design style attempts to increase website speed and minimize scrolling and clicking, and it works across all devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t ignore the importance of your mobile website. What seems responsible on a desktop may be clunky or unreadable on a phone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Easy Social Media Access</strong></h2>



<p>If your brand has a strong social media presence (and it should), make sure that your guests have easy access to your platforms. Remember, your social media and your other forms of <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">digital marketing</a> should work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most popular way of doing this is to put easy-to-see icons that match each social media site or app on the front page of your site (or on your contact page). This way, people don&#8217;t have to search.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Clean Navigation</strong></h2>



<p>Have you ever been attempting to navigate a site just to discover that it&#8217;s impossible to find (or click) what you&#8217;re looking for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an easy mistake that you might not notice if you never run tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make sure that all of your important pages are accessible from your main page. It&#8217;s helpful to include a directory at the bottom as well as a navigation bar or drop-down menu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have drop-down menus, make sure that they are functional. Many people make the mistake of making the menus too sensitive, making it difficult to click on anything without making the menu disappear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will frustrate your guests and take them elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Frequent Feedback&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The best way to make sure that you&#8217;re providing the best user experience, check in with your users and keep track of your visitors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feedback isn&#8217;t always verbal. You can survey visitors to ask them what they like and dislike, but you can also track <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp">website metrics</a> to see if what you&#8217;re doing is working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll be able to see how many people are visiting your website, how long they&#8217;re staying, and if you have a good conversion rate.</p>



<h2><strong>Improve User Experience Today</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to improve user experience for your website, it&#8217;s time for a redesign. Make sure that you create a website that&#8217;s responsive and easy to navigate, and that visitors can go from your site to your social platforms with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do routine check-ins to see how you&#8217;re doing and watch your business grow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obtaining first page rankings on search engines can be difficult, and impossible without SEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is SEO? Search Engine Optimization is a strategy that brings <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-reasons-website-traffic_b_6628080">quality website traffic</a>. It optimizes your online content to increase the visibility of your brand based on specific keywords.</p>



<p>Not convinced about trying this form of marketing? Read on to learn a few benefits of SEO.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Builds Credibility and Trust</strong></h2>



<p>One of the biggest SEO advantages is establishing strong foundations for your website. It&#8217;s a strategy that can bring you to the top of search engine results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If consumers see your site on the first page, customers get encouraged to click on your site. Being on the first page gives your customers the idea that you&#8217;re <a href="https://fleek.marketing/news/brand-credibility-how-to-stand-out-from-fake-news">one of the top</a> industry players.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Increases Traffic and Conversions</strong></h2>



<p>One of the main reasons you have a website is to stand out from the crowd and gain a customer base. SEO will help you bring in more customers and higher conversion rates.</p>



<p>SEO brings &#8220;targeted traffic&#8221; into your website. This means you bring in customers who already expressed an interest in your site&#8217;s niche based off of the keywords they are searching. As long as your page is relevant to their search, customers are more likely to stay on your site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SEO-optimized sites are smoother and faster on all types of devices. It makes your website easy to navigate, which grabs more attention from visitors. This may lead to returning visitors and loyal customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Establishes Brand Awareness</strong></h2>



<p>As stated earlier, SEO benefits your website&#8217;s search engine ranks. The higher your rank, the more customers will find your brand. Internet users will click on your page and learn more about your brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Bypasses Your Competition</strong></h2>



<p>There are plenty of other businesses that sell and price the same products that you have. SEO keeps you ahead of your competition&#8217;s website and search rank. With better content creation and strategic keywords, you&#8217;ll beat your competition in SEO.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. Influences the Buying Cycle</strong></h2>



<p>Customers do a lot of research. It&#8217;s one of the biggest SEO advantages from a seller&#8217;s perspective. When your product appears in their research, customers will likely check out your brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SEO relays your messages for better deals and groundbreaking services or products. This encourages buyers to try out your products, benefiting your buying cycle.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Becomes Your Long-Term Strategy</strong></h2>



<p>SEO marketing typically ends up as a long-term strategy since it may take a while for your page to reach first page ranking. You also should be consistent in keeping your site on top of page one into the future. The more effort you put into SEO, the longer your website stays <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/how-to-build-a-better-brand-by-analyzing-your-direct-competitors/">above your competition</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Improves Website Usability</strong></h2>



<p>SEO helps your website become more navigable for search engines and users. It&#8217;s a strategy that rearranges your site&#8217;s links and architecture to make your pages easier to navigate and find. This also makes it easier for search engine crawlers to find and rank your site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The internet is a busy place with almost <a href="https://www.internetlivestats.com/total-number-of-websites/">200 million active websites</a>. Your business website is a small fish in an enormous sea!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did you think customers would come because you built a website? It doesn&#8217;t work that way. Now that you&#8217;re up and running, it&#8217;s time for some serious online marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How? Keep reading for five clever online marketing tactics to get your website noticed.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Be Weird</strong></h2>



<p>This may seem odd, but it works. Take a look at dozens of ads and online marketing campaigns in your niche. What digital marketing strategy is your biggest competitor using?</p>



<p>Come up with a weird idea that turns that marketing on its head. Potential customers love something that stands out and grabs their attention. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voqdFtr7FjU">weird Snickers ad</a> that got a lot of attention for the brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Use humor and irreverence but make sure you keep it tasteful. Think outside the box. Customers love seeing something different and a little against the grain.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Respond to Social Media</strong></h2>



<p>How many times have you said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to respond to these social media comments?&#8221; Don&#8217;t think of it as wasted time. It&#8217;s a clever online marketing strategy and the perfect way to connect with potential customers.</p>



<p>Responding to social media is sometimes time-consuming, but it&#8217;s free and easy. It&#8217;s also something not every company does, especially if you&#8217;re a small business. It does take time, but it&#8217;s well worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Contest Giveaway</strong></h2>



<p>People love free stuff and you can use that to your advantage. Run an online giveaway contest. This is a fantastic way to get customer leads.</p>



<p>Announce what you&#8217;re giving away on social media. Ideally, it&#8217;s one of your products. Provide a link where people exchange their email addresses for a chance to win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can run low-cost social media ads promoting the giveaway and you&#8217;ll end up with hundreds of leads per giveaway. Speaking of email leads&#8230;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Email Marketing&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Your email list is one of your most valuable marketing tools. Email marketing isn&#8217;t the sexiest but it <em>is effective</em>. It&#8217;s also the perfect way to get <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/5-strategies-to-build-an-excellent-online-brand/">your brand</a> in front of potential customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t overload your customers with emails. Send one a week and &#8220;romance&#8221; your customers. Offer them value and good content in exchange for opening the email.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a burgeoning business, there&#8217;s little more valuable than creating a solid brand, and building awareness around it. This is why <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/#topbrandingstatisticseditorschoice:~:text=Over%2070%25%20of%20brand%20managers%20consider%20building%20an%20audience%20more%20important%20than%20converting%20sales.,-89%25">over 70% of brand managers</a> say building an audience more important than converting sales.</p>



<p>Boosting brand awareness is vital for many reasons. It allows consumers to get to know your company better and it enables you to create the narrative you want around your business. It also makes your brand more memorable and instantly recognizable.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been proven that people don&#8217;t just care about products anymore, they care about the brands behind them almost as much. Digital marketing is one of the fastest and most effective ways to curate your company&#8217;s branding and <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/310427">build brand awareness</a>. Read on to find out how.</p>



<h2><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></h2>



<p>Over the past 10 years or so, SEO has become one of the biggest digital marketing channels there is. With good reason. SEO is an amazing tool that allows you to connect with consumers who are specifically seeking products or services like yours.</p>



<p>When employed in the right way, it drives more traffic to your website which, in turn, gets more eyes on your brand. This is why ultimately, this strategy is one of the best ways to <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-big-benefits-of-seo-for-your-business/#post-3010:~:text=3.%20Strengthen%20Brand%20Awareness,strengthen%20your%20brand%20awareness%20over%20time.">increase brand recognition and awareness</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Content Marketing</strong></h2>



<p>Content marketing is another powerful digital marketing tool that serves a unique purpose in building brand identity and awareness. By creating quality content such as blogs, videos, and ebooks, you can establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry. You can also use your content to solidify and amplify your brand message, whatever that may be.</p>



<p>All of these things will help in creating a strong brand identity, which, again, will make your brand more memorable and recognizable to customers. It will also act as an encouragement to consumers, with whom your message resonates, to purchase your product over your competition’s product.</p>



<h2><strong>Social Media</strong></h2>



<p>One of the great things about building a brand is that it allows you to connect with your audience on a deeper level. This is an authentic way of <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/the-key-importance-of-building-a-brand-for-your-business/#post-3007:~:text=Build%20Credibility%20in%20Your%20Industry,develop%20even%20more%20trust%20and%20credibility.">increasing credibility and building trust</a> with your audience. There are few places that this is easier done than on your brand&#8217;s social media channels.</p>



<p>Social media allows you to curate your brand&#8217;s message and aesthetics. Branding consistency across social media channels has been proven to increase brand recognition. Social media also offers you a unique chance to interact directly with your audience, which makes your brand more relatable, accessible, and likable.</p>

<p>Content marketing is essential for any brand&#8217;s story. If you want to <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics">build brand awareness and trust over 75%</a>, you need to invest in compelling content. Establishing a narrative provides consumers with consistent messaging and clarity.</p>



<p>The more consumers understand your business, the better your ROI and lead generation. Read this guide to elevate your marketing with essential brand storytelling.</p>



<h2><strong>What Is Brand Storytelling?</strong></h2>



<p>When most people think of marketing, the first thought to cross their minds is usually about advertising. Some might think of memorable jingles, clever characters, or other brand icons. These all play a part in how to tell a story about a company.</p>



<p>In digital marketing, telling a brand story starts with answering a few basic questions. These questions are often critical to your business&#8217;s daily functions and core offerings. You&#8217;ll want to consider the following:</p>



<ol><li>What&#8217;s your reason for being in business?</li><li>How did your business come to be?</li><li>Who&#8217;s the face of your company?</li><li>What makes your business unique?</li><li>Which failures have impacted your company?</li></ol>



<p>Answering these questions can help write a story showcasing your brand&#8217;s voice. With a clear voice, your messaging becomes clearer. And the more clearly consumers recognize your brand, the more they&#8217;ll trust and purchase from your company.</p>



<p>Combined with the right marketing strategy, these answers provide valuable insight to current and potential customers. You can hone ongoing and upcoming campaigns with better-targeted narratives, too. The most important focus for telling a brand&#8217;s story is the <a href="https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/centers/oralcommunication/guides/how-to-engage-your-audience-and-keep-them-with-you">focus on your audience</a>, after all.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Boost Your Digital Marketing Through Storytelling</strong></h2>



<p>Now you know what brand storytelling is, it&#8217;s time to break down how to tell a story for your marketing. Crafting a narrative is all about communicating with your audience. You need to know who you currently serve and compare that to who you want to serve.</p>



<p>You can use a few factors to leverage your company values and history. When you combine these factors, you&#8217;ll end up with a successful brand strategy. Consider these elements when aligning narratives within your content marketing.</p>



<ul><li>Audience profile: current and prospective people, based on ideal clients and buyer personas</li><li>Tone of voice: how you craft content (e.g., professional, enthusiastic, friendly)</li><li><a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/a-guide-to-writing-the-perfect-company-boilerplate-text">Boilerplate paragraph</a>: standard communication for consistent messaging</li><li>Messaging scenarios: possible interaction points with current and prospective consumers</li></ul>



<p>When you consider these elements, along with the answers about your brand, you can write a story for your brand. A trusted and relatable brand story combines these elements successfully. <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/branding-services/">Expert branding services</a> can help you integrate them correctly.</p>



<h2><strong>Tell Your Brand&#8217;s Story With a Holistic Approach</strong></h2>



<p>You know that strong brand storytelling offers increased awareness online. Making a strong first impression online requires the right narrative. It also requires the right storyteller to share your brand voice.</p>



<p>Even though you know your brand better than anyone else, your story deserves a professional perspective. At DG Studio, we can help craft a narrative to outshine competitors and position your brand for success. <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/contact-us/">Schedule a free consultation</a> with us to develop an unforgettable presence online.</p>

<p>Brand consistency can <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/branding-statistics">increase revenue by a third</a>. One way to ensure your brand description stays consistent is through a properly formatted tool. Consistent messaging is critical when communicating across platforms and media.</p>



<p>Learn how to write the perfect boilerplate text for your company&#8217;s marketing with this guide. Boost your online presence and virtual impressions with well-crafted content.</p>



<h2><strong>What Makes a Company Boilerplate?</strong></h2>



<p>Your boilerplate text needs to include basic elements. These components ensure your text is standardized for consistent messaging. Your boilerplate should include:</p>



<ul><li>Date and place of company founding</li><li>Products and services</li><li>Company mission</li><li>Milestones, awards, and honors</li><li>Social media accounts</li><li>Contact information</li></ul>



<p>These are essential details for your company boilerplate. Make sure to prioritize brevity and relevance for quick reference. Your boilerplate is all about streamlining content marketing.</p>



<h2><strong>The Extras In Your Brand Description</strong></h2>



<p>For a fuller and more comprehensive boilerplate, you can include other details, too. Including these details is ultimately up to your current marketing strategy. These may be unnecessary or add a little extra to your brand description.</p>



<ul><li>Company founders: ideal for older companies with well-known, established faces</li><li>Size and location: noteworthy company sizes should be shared; think 300 or more employees</li><li>Revenue and funding: if you&#8217;ve made a lot, share it, especially if backed by a famous client</li><li>Customers and users: mention this if you&#8217;ve got an impressive amount of customers&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Consistent messaging ensures accessible information about your company. This helps present a cohesive brand story and demonstrates your credibility and professionalism. There are ways to use boilerplate to boost your marketing, too.</p>



<h2><strong>Content Marketing and Boilerplate Go Together Like&#8230;</strong></h2>



<p>With all the essentials and extras for a company boilerplate, it&#8217;s important to find ways to optimize it. Everything you include in your boilerplate can boost your marketing strategy. Boilerplate is just another form of content, after all.</p>



<p>Writing a boilerplate is straightforward. It&#8217;s important to emphasize things specific to the core of your company. Your brand description should be brief and appealing to add clarity and power.</p>



<p>Most importantly, you should optimize your text for readers and search engines. The most relevant keywords, alongside a strong CTA, elevate your content marketing. The call to action ensures people find more about your brand.</p>



<h3><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget to Take a Stand</strong></h3>



<p>The key ingredient to any elevator pitch is a strong position. The same goes for creating a boilerplate. You can&#8217;t have one without a positioning statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positioning statement expresses why your company is important. The statement is no more than one sentence and showcases your company&#8217;s main accomplishment.</p>



<h2><strong>Boost More Than Your Boilerplate Text With a Holistic Approach</strong></h2>



<p>Your company boilerplate isn&#8217;t the only thing clients and partners see. Your content and other elements of your marketing impact your virtual presence. A holistic approach from branding to web design to ad content impacts your appearance online.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201711/sheila-marikar/website-design-marketing.html">Nearly 40% of users</a> will leave a website if they find it unattractive. Although an aesthetically pleasing site is ideal, it&#8217;s not the only thing that matters. Web design trends aren&#8217;t just about looking good; they&#8217;re about functioning well, too.</p>



<p>As more users browse the web each year, expectations change, and these expectations shape 2021 design trends. Learn what&#8217;s coming in the year ahead to elevate your website&#8217;s design.</p>



<h2><strong>Animation Sensation</strong></h2>



<p>As graphic design trends stretch the bounds of immersion online, web animation is changing. The parallax scroll animation has increased in popularity significantly. Ideally, these are used to bring static illustrations to life.</p>



<p>Avoid using the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp">parallax scroll</a> for important tasks and information. Don&#8217;t overuse a good thing, no matter how cool it looks. Offer an option to elevate UI design with a choice for deactivating parallax effects.</p>



<p>These considerations elevate your site&#8217;s design without going overboard. Ensure whatever parallax effects you use are minimized to targeted portions of a viewport.</p>



<h2><strong>Easy On the Eyes</strong></h2>



<p>With people spending more and more time online, web design trends change to match. Instead of bold, bright, flashy color palettes, comfortable colors increase in popularity. Wearing out site visitors&#8217; eyes brought on the popularity of dark mode in 2020 to accommodate this fatigue.</p>



<p>UI trends favor pastel tones and warmer shades. Pure black and white jars the eyes and makes it less accessible to various users. And accessibility is also an increasing trend online.</p>



<h2><strong>UX Designs For a Cause</strong></h2>



<p>2021 design trends don&#8217;t just favor comfort for eye fatigue. More and more, site visitors of varying abilities are online. As UX design changes to accommodate user needs, so does general expectation.</p>



<p>Site visitors want web designs to include every type of user as accessibility standards increase worldwide, expectations for every kind of website change. Elevate every user&#8217;s experience ahead of time by breaking new ground.</p>



<p>Implementing <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">ahead of the curve</a> web development communicates your company&#8217;s ethos. Accessibility isn&#8217;t a trend any more than caring is. Show your customers you care by taking measures to include everyone online.</p>



<h2><strong>New Dimensions</strong></h2>



<p>Web design trends are barrier-breaking and dimension-defying all over. As basic UI design accelerates across viewports and operation systems, design needs to accommodate this. That means breaking into the third dimension.</p>



<p>Using new ways to demonstrate products, you can elevate the online shopping experience. Your site can creatively interpret physical media to bring literal depth to your design. Whether it&#8217;s dimensional color use or integrating a 3D tool, boost your UX design with this kind of development.</p>



<h2><strong>Break New Ground and Prep for 2021 Design Trends</strong></h2>



<p>With your knowledge of this year&#8217;s upcoming trends, you&#8217;re ready to improve your website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2021 design trends mean breaking new ground on the bones of your old site. Developing new design features requires a skilled hand.</p>
