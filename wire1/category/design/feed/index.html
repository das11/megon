<p>A website is one of the most important <a href="https://medium.com/@oliosolutions/8-reasons-why-a-website-is-important-for-your-business-success-d833205380e">digital marketing tools</a> your business has. It&#8217;s available 24 hours a day for potential customers, so you want to make sure they can access the information they want when they want it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s important to have a website, you also need to make sure your web design is innovative and in line with the current trends. If you want to know what&#8217;s on the horizon in web page design for 2021, read on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Parallax Animations</strong></h2>



<p>Parallax scrolling is a design technique where the images in the foreground move faster than the images in the background. This gives your site visitors a 3D effect as they are scrolling through the various pages of your site and creates almost an immersive effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While parallax scrolling isn&#8217;t new this year, it is gaining in popularity and you&#8217;ll see it incorporated into websites more and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Soothing Colors</strong></h2>



<p>We spend more than <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01">11 hours per day</a> staring at screens—laptops, phones, tablets, televisions, etc. More of our waking hours are spent in front of screens than not, so it&#8217;s imperative that your website has a color that is <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/2021-design-trends-that-will-shape-the-web/">easy on the eyes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neutral color schemes that are pleasing and soothing to your eyes are becoming more and more popular. Think soft color palettes like pastel blues and greens, warm browns, and light pink. Combined with the dark mode trend, which reduces some of the white we see on screens, these colors can invoke relaxation and calm the viewer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Augmented Reality&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Another immersive experience is augmented reality or AR. AR allows the user to see objects that exist in real life in a computer-generated experience. Car dealers are using this more and more to allow consumers to experience the car without ever setting foot on a car lot.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Horizontal Scrolling</strong></h2>



<p>Horizontal scrolling on a webpage was once a big no-no, but if done properly and used sparingly, it can be an effective tool for image galleries however. For example, a photographer could use horizontal scrolling to convey information through a gallery of pictures that the user scrolls through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to use horizontal scrolling, be sure you give the user an alternative means to see the content, such as arrows or buttons that are clearly labeled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3D Visuals</strong></h2>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses to adapt in ways they never imagined. Stay-at-home orders and orders to shut down certain business services have necessitated that more and more industries incorporate 3D visuals. You can see inside restaurants, commercial and residential properties, and other businesses all from the comfort of your own home.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Incorporate These Web Design Trends Into Your Site&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to take your web design to the next level, it&#8217;s time to incorporate some of these new trends for 2021. A site that is current, aesthetically pleasing, and shows visitors that you are in tune to current trends demonstrates that your business is on the cutting edge and also keeps visitors on your site longer.</p>

<p>When you started your business website you probably found one of those sleek templates on an easy-to-use platform to use as a base, right?</p>



<p>This is common for new business owners. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it per se, but is it the best option? Why not opt for a custom website that&#8217;s your own? There are plenty of benefits to custom web design for your business, but many people choose not to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t believe us? Keep reading to learn why custom web design with a web design agency is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>1. Custom Designs Look Better</h2>



<p>If you read only one point, make it this one.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no doubt about it. Custom web design looks better. When you pay for custom web design services, you&#8217;re paying for quality and professionals who know how to do things right.</p>



<p>You might be great at using the templates provided by popular website hosts, but they&#8217;re templates. Everyone uses them, so you won&#8217;t have a unique site to call your own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re running a business, this matters. Go custom for a site that looks great.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. You Gain Customer Trust</h2>



<p>Consider your own customer experience. When you&#8217;re on a website for a business, what do you expect from it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You expect things to be clear, well-designed, easy to navigate, and full of important information, right? This is where professional website designers come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want your customers to see you as a <a href="https://www.bizbritain.com/blog/importance-of-building-trust-between-you-and-customers">trustworthy business</a>, they need to see that you take your online presence seriously.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. Your Branding Stays Consistent&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your branding is everything as a business owner. You want consistency from your promotional materials to your social media, so why should that stop at your website?</p>



<p>When you choose to get a custom-designed website, you&#8217;re choosing to get designers who want to work with you until you get the perfect site that matches your individual brand. They make your ideas come to life.</p>



<p>You might think that you&#8217;ll get a better fit by doing it yourself. After all, <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/the-art-of-brand-positioning/">it&#8217;s your brand</a>. Trust us, though. Designers have the experience to amplify your ideas.</p>



<h2>4. The Website Is More User-Friendly</h2>



<p>A website that&#8217;s difficult to navigate is useless. Consider all of the websites that you&#8217;ve seen where search bars are impossible to find, drop-down menus interfere with each other, and pictures overlap text.</p>



<p>Does that look professional? Does it improve your <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-experience.html">user experience</a>?</p>



<p>No, of course not. When you hire professionals to put your website together, you can ensure that these problems don&#8217;t happen.</p>



<h2>5. Scalability Is Key</h2>



<p>Do you want your business to grow and develop over time? You need a website that&#8217;s scalable. It&#8217;s confusing to try to do that on your own.</p>



<p>Your designers know how to handle this. You&#8217;ll continue having a beautiful website as your needs expand and change. Don&#8217;t feel limited by the website that you started.</p>



<h2>Custom Web Design Is Crucial</h2>



<p>Don&#8217;t settle for a DIY website. Hiring a professional for custom web design can get you more customers, improve the user experience (UX), and ultimately support the aesthetic and trust of your brand. Why risk your customers just because you feel like cutting corners?</p>



<p>We want to build you the website that you deserve. <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/contact-us/">Contact us for a free consultation</a> so we can bring your ideas to life!</p>

<p>There are several differences between web design and <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development</a>, but they&#8217;re both important. They work together to build an excellent website that attracts audiences and impresses users.</p>



<p>Web designers are skilled in design and have studied more than just technology. They know how to organize information so that users can access it easily while impressing them with your brand. A good web designer will make a website that people want to go to and explore.</p>



<p>Web developers, on the other hand, work behind the scenes on your website. They create the actual infrastructure of web pages that make your website able to exist in the first place. People hire them if they don&#8217;t want to depend on third parties for their website and want to host it themselves.</p>



<h3><strong>Web Designers Aren&#8217;t as Technical as Web Developers</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to make a website for your business, you probably want to hire a web designer. Although they do not build the actual infrastructure of websites, most of the time you don&#8217;t need it. There are third party options available for business owners who don&#8217;t want to think about the technical details of web development.</p>



<p>Instead, it&#8217;s better to invest in the actual organization of your business&#8217;s information and the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/03/04/10-website-design-trends-for-2020/#783217467645">design of your website</a>. You should invest in making sure that your users can access information about you, since you don&#8217;t need to worry about hosting it. And for that, you want to hire a web designer.</p>



<h2><strong>Don&#8217;t Go It Alone — Hire Help</strong></h2>



<p>Even if you just put out <a href="https://medium.com/collabos/6-steps-to-successfully-hiring-your-first-freelancer-3004f8bb38e1">advertisements for freelancers</a>, it&#8217;s important that you hire a web designer before building a website. Most people think they can simply use a platform to build their website, but it&#8217;s not that simple. Just because you have the tools to build a website doesn&#8217;t mean you know how to use them.</p>



<p>Web designers have skills in parts of websites that most people never realize even exist. Getting those things wrong will cost your business revenue since people know when the colors on your web page are off if an animation is broken. They simply won&#8217;t want to use it.</p>



<h2><strong>Building a Website is an Investment</strong></h2>



<p>Knowing whether you should invest in web design vs web development is just the first step. After deciding on which kind of professional to hire, you need to actually create a website for your company. It&#8217;s not easy, and any good business leader would say that it&#8217;s better to do so.</p>

<p>The design of your website can be thought of as your storefront. It represents who you are as a business and shows customers what you are all about. In fact, it may be even more important than a physical storefront as research from <a href="https://www.business.com/articles/7-website-design-mistakes-that-can-hurt-conversion/">Standford&#8217;s Web Credibility Study</a> reveals 75 percent of consumers judge a business&#8217;s credibility based on the company&#8217;s web design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your web design is not up to the consumer&#8217;s standards, they will simply disregard it as an illegitimate business and most likely go to the competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can avoid this by taking advantage of the latest web design trends. Keep reading to discover the top 3 trends in web design in 2020 that you can implement today.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Minimalism</strong></h2>



<p>Minimalism is a growing trend over the past few years that has managed to make a name for itself in the digital world of web design. It involves owning less but, above all else, being happy and content without an abundance of material possessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Minimalism is also expressed through art and creativity &#8211; proving simplicity can have profound effects on where the viewer&#8217;s attention is focused. With less information to distract the viewer, web designers can focus on grabbing the consumer&#8217;s attention and allow them to complete the intended action naturally; for example, clicking on your main call-to-action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More whitespace on your website is not necessarily a bad thing as previously thought, it can help highlight the information you are trying to portray to the user.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Responsive Design</strong></h2>



<p>Responsiveness is one of the most critical trends in web design that is here to stay. Having a responsive design will ensure your website&#8217;s layout, and the content that fills it will load correctly on any device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea of a responsive web design is that all of your web page elements are scaled and will respond to the screen it&#8217;s being viewed on. According to <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf">research from Adobe</a>, 38 percent of consumers will abandon the website if the layout doesn&#8217;t load correctly.</p>



<p>Having a responsive web design will not only please your mobile viewers, it can also give a boost to your technical search engine optimization (SEO). Better SEO practices will increase your visibility on the web and allow consumers to find you easier through search engines like Google.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Focus on the User Experience</strong></h2>



<p>Companies have, for the most part, always focused on the consumer. However, online it takes a bit more creativity to get the message across.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way of implementing this through <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development</a> is by creating trust with the consumer. Trust can be created in a variety of ways like:</p>



<ul><li>Providing testimonies</li><li>Interacting with users</li><li>Providing reputable links</li><li>Maintaining quality information</li></ul>



<p>Creating trust with your consumers is essential, especially if you are looking to <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/branding-services/">build a brand</a> and continue growing your business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Looking to Take Advantage of These Web Design Trends?</strong></h2>



<p>These web design trends are helping companies stand out and make a name for themselves on the internet. It&#8217;s more critical than ever to have an online presence as consumers are going online at record-breaking amounts. Taking advantage of these website trends can help give your business the competitive advantage it needs to stay ahead of the competition. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible to optimize well, attract a lot of traffic, and still have issues turning that traffic into conversions. For those who are new to digital marketing, it might seem like nothing is working and that the visitors you do get aren&#8217;t doing much for your bottom line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A couple of things to look at are exit rate and bounce rate. These are terms that refer to the types of behavior your users show when they arrive at your site. We&#8217;re going to take a look at these issues today, giving you an idea of how to improve them when things aren&#8217;t going your way.</p>



<h2>How to Improve Your Exit Rate</h2>



<p>The website exit rate and bounce rate are often confused because they&#8217;re pretty close to the same thing. An &#8220;exit&#8221; is an instance when the user leaves your site at any point during the session. The &#8220;exit rate&#8221; refers to the percentage of exits there are in the grand scheme of your users&#8217; interactions with your site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if all users arrived at your site and left immediately, your exit rate would be 100%. If they all visited an additional page in their sessions, your exit rate would be 50% because half of the interactions they made were exits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A bounce refers to a user who finds your landing page and exits without exploring at all.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What Do High Rates Reflect?</h3>



<p>Naturally, you want to have low exits and bounce rates. When looking to reduce your exit rate, it&#8217;s important to note that there&#8217;s always something in the user experience that&#8217;s not quite clicking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The user was enticed by your ad or a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanrobinson/2019/09/18/social-media-marketing-strategy/#23223b6b1ff3">post on social media</a>, but something about the page didn&#8217;t pull them in. There are a few principles that you can follow to reliably decrease your bounce and exit rates, though, and they&#8217;re not too complicated to put into action.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Adjust Readability</h3>



<p>It should be natural and easy for users to browse through the information on your site. Whether it&#8217;s a product page or a piece of blog content, you never want to display a wall of text for the user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Space your paragraphs up in groups of two-to-four sentences. Also, make sure there&#8217;s <a href="https://writingcenter.ashford.edu/writing-clearly-concisely">a logical progression</a> in the information. Further, offer additional resources throughout your content to promote engagement throughout your site.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Work with a Graphic Designer</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/what-is-ux-design-and-why-is-it-so-important/">User experience</a> also pertains to the layout and look of your site. If a site looks and feels great, people will be more inclined to engage with it. Not only is it more enjoyable to spend time on a beautiful site, but it gives your business a feeling of credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, include a call to some kind of action. What&#8217;s the point of creating the content if there isn&#8217;t an end goal in mind? Give the user a direction to your products, services, or more of your content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These factors, when done well, will really help to reduce those pesky bounce and exit rates.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Need Help with Digital Marketing?</h2>



<p>Digital marketing involves a lot more than your exit rate. There&#8217;s a whole process that goes into attracting the user in the first place. We&#8217;re here to help you through it.</p>

<p>Great design can make a massive impact on the number of customers who engage with your website. However, if your website is all style and no substance, your potential customers may be clicking away from your site moments later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While a pretty website is nice, it won&#8217;t help your online business grow without good UX. UX design is the key to having a website that looks good and converts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is UX design, and why does it matter? Good question. Read on to learn more about UX and how it can help your business thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is UX Design?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Understanding your customers&#8217; needs is the first rule of marketing. Once you know what your customer needs, the next step is to ensure those needs are met in every stage of working with you.</p>



<p>A customer visits your website to learn more about your business, choose which service is right for them, buy products, and more. No matter what you use your website for, making sure that it&#8217;s easy to use is vital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>UX stands for user experience. When you design with UX in mind, you&#8217;re creating a website that responds to your customers&#8217; needs as efficiently as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/good-ux-examples/">Good UX design</a> makes interacting with your website enjoyable. Creating a website with intuitive navigation, engaging content, and clear calls to action are all part of a positive user experience.</p>



<p>While UX design is frequently referencing websites, it also applies to marketing collateral, mobile apps, online forms, and even physical product design. A UX designer researches user behavior to continually iterate and provide an experience that users expect. That may mean UX team members are testing web pages, issuing surveys, and empathizing with your customer to improve SEO rankings, PPC campaigns, branding, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why is UX Important for Small Businesses?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>As a small business, you develop close relationships with your customers. Ensuring that your customer feels understood, seen, and cared for makes UX design for small businesses a must.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Competing with big brands is easier when small brands focus on their strengths. One of those strengths is having closer proximity and intimacy with your <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/why-knowing-your-target-audience-is-important/">target audience</a>. Even just by living and working in the same area, you have a better idea of what your clients look for in a product or service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a better understanding of your customer personas, you can define a user experience that incorporates multiple aspects of your business. For example, you may look at your analytics data and see that people are bouncing from your website after only viewing one page. That may lead you to focus on speeding up your site for better SEO performance or creating a landing page that aligns with PPC campaigns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are many ways <a href="https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/ux-and-cro/the-dos-and-donts-of-ux-design-for-small-business/">UX strategies</a> can help your business save money without major changes. Working with a marketing team that prioritizes UX can help you deliver an experience that turns leads to customers!</p>



<h2><strong>Designing With the User in Mind</strong></h2>



<p>Creating <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">marketing campaigns</a> and a website that meet your client where they are is the best way to attract new clients. However, lots of small business owners have no clue where to start.</p>

<p>In many cases, when a person thinks of a website, he or she thinks of a single type of entity.</p>



<p>But in truth, websites come in a <em>variety</em> of different forms. Are you curious as to what the different types of websites look like?</p>



<p>Keep reading because we&#8217;re going to cover the most common website types below!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Blog</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most common types of websites is <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/expert-tips-that-i-wish-i-knew-before-starting-a-blog/">the blog</a>. A blog is a website that provides information surrounding a niche topic. For instance, it might provide in-depth info on camping in Ohio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blogs are article-driven websites. The more articles they have published on them, the more engagement they see. Often times, blog owners will monetize their blogs through the use of ads and affiliate links.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Business Website</h2>



<p>These days, if they want to make it, businesses have to be online. As such, the <a href="https://www.business2community.com/web-design/the-importance-of-websites-for-business-02280759">business website</a> is extremely common.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point of a business website is to provide a business with an online presence. It serves almost as the business&#8217; digital storefront, providing consumers with a spot where they can go to get questions answered and to learn more about products or services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though business websites need to be updated regularly, they don&#8217;t require as much content as a website that is solely a blog.</p>



<h2>E-Commerce Website</h2>



<p>Online retail is essentially taking over the world at this point, and its active avenue is the E-commerce website. E-commerce websites are literal online marketplaces. They not only advertise available products but allow consumers to buy said products on the spot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most obvious example of an E-commerce site would be Amazon. But there are much smaller options out there as well.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Online Portfolio</h2>



<p>Similar to, but a little different from the business website is the online portfolio. Online portfolios allow individuals to showcase their work, whether that work is in writing, or art, or photography, or modeling, or otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Typically very simple in nature, their main objective is to expose their subjects to interested parties. They&#8217;re almost like resumes, you could say.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Media Website</h2>



<p>The last website we&#8217;ll discuss is the media website. This is a website that contains videos or images for the sole sake of facilitating those videos or images. They include websites like YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo, Pixabay, and the like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Note, media websites require much larger servers than do most other sites. This is due to the extravagant amount of data needed to upload and stream images and video.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Which Types of Websites Suit You Best?</h2>



<p>In truth, this blog post covers only a few types of websites. In actuality, there are hundreds of different types that you can create.</p>



<p>Not sure which types of websites suit you best? We here at DG Studio are the people to see. We provide top-notch <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development services</a>, helping businesses and individuals to build a strong online presence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself, what is a “User Journey” in relation to a website. The idea of going on a &#8216;journey&#8217; probably sounds a little daunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “journey” we are talking about in web design is the path which a user (customer) travels on while visiting your website.</p>



<p>The actions a user takes on your website all involve the User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) of your website. It is important to envision the path which you would like to have visitors take once they arrive to your website.</p>



<h2><strong>Websites and User Journey</strong></h2>



<p>Rather than having a website where every link online leads to a generic homepage, a much better journey for your users can be to send them to specific pages and guide them along an exact route.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The route would begin at their arrival to the website and end with the action you want them to take, either a purchase or reaching out to contact you (in most cases).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Otherwise, it can be like visiting a huge retail outlet that you’ve never been to. You have a specific purchase in mind, yet your initial task is to try and find the right area of the store by wandering around for some time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Signage is often confusing &#8211; or absent &#8211; and if there are no staff ready to help&#8230; you might simply decide it&#8217;s not worth the effort and leave. Exactly the same reaction is often true of a visitor to a website, looking for something specific, yet left at a generic homepage, users can simply leave to find another site.</p>



<h2><strong>Continuing the journey</strong></h2>



<p>Having overcome the problem just highlighted, it&#8217;s important that the visitor is then faced with a simple journey to the endpoint you wish them to reach. This might be one of a range of actions, perhaps to make an online purchase, download a guide, or to contact the business to discuss their needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clear links are vital, an avoidance of insider jargon is helpful, and offers of immediate help (such as chatbox facilities) can soothe the experience.</p>



<p>Creating custom websites is one of the many tasks our talented one-stop digital marketing agency can undertake to move your business forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the process of developing your website, one crucial step is to optimize it for search engines. The optimization of your site should be a top priority as a business owner, and it can help you accomplish the following goals:</p>



<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Have a high-quality website that ranks highly in search engine results<br><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;An easy to use site that loads quickly <br><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;An increment in your online traffic</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to optimize your site?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or website optimization describes the methods used to optimize or to design from scratch a website to rate well in search engines; in other words, how fast your website loads in a web browser.</p>



<p><strong>How can I improve SEO on my website?</strong></p>



<p>The following are suggestions for your website to rank to the top of Search Engine Results; keep in mind that you should be doing these tasks on a regular basis to maintain an optimized website.</p>



<p><strong>1. Publish relevant content &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>Quality content is the number one driver of your Search Engine rankings. There is no substitute for great content. A website that offers in-depth information on specific subjects, the more content, the better, especially if the site’s objective is to sell a product or service. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>2. Update your content regularly &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>All content should be original and continuously refreshed, an essential factor in keeping site users interested and coming back for more. Besides, the focus on keyword identification and evaluation is critical. Keywords should be relevant to your site’s copy and overall topic, this way you can make your website more available for search engine indexing, which allows the finding, scanning, and indexing of your site. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>3. Include metadata &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>The description of the web content for a search engine should include the type of material on a webpage and a title (HTML’s meta tag) for the content on the site, which is shown in the results by search engines. Also, it should include meta keywords that are related to the content on the website and are provided to the search engine. &nbsp;As an example, the page’s title should consist of your business name + #1 keyword, the same with the slogan, it should also include the top keyword. This small task contributes to the optimization of your business name and consequently of your website too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>4. Have a link-worthy site &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>a site with rich and relevant content about the product or service becomes more approachable and more likely to be linked to and shared by multiple users.</p>



<p><strong>5. Create Landing Pages &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;It’s crucial for your landing pages to use your product’s most relevant keywords on the title and the content. Also, there might be multiple keywords that apply to your product or promotion, in this case, you may have to test them on various landing pages. Just keep in mind that each page should focus on one word at a time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It takes careful planning to develop the best strategies for a website’s optimization. First of all, you must analyze, evaluate your site, and determine what the issues are. Therefore proceed to make the changes necessary to attract more traffic and take steps to classify highly in search engines.</p>

<p>It seems as though every few months, a new technology device is out on the market. Whether it’s a new tablet, a new laptop, or larger phones, technology continues to innovate machinery forcing us, the public, to adjust. A few years ago, however, company websites failed to receive the memo, thus attempting to cater new technology appearing on the market. More than one website was created for the same product, service or company.</p>



<p>This was inevitably time consuming, costly, and a confusing way of attempting to stay relevant. The creation of two URLs, additionally caused problems when establishing rankings and a following for said websites. Thankfully, a new way of staying up-to-date with technology was generated.</p>



<p>Responsive Web Design (RWD) is a type of web design specifically produced for an optimized viewing experience for users, offering facilitated reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning or scrolling across wide-ranging devices. A website designed with RWD adapts its viewing and functionality to that of any device, improving user experiences. With only one website/URL, generating and maintaining an audience can finally be achieved! RWD saves you time by managing one website and save you money by investing in one website creation.</p>



<p>By developing a company website using RWD, you will provide yourself with an added advantage &#8211; the opportunity to stay ahead of the game, as not many companies recognize the benefits using such design will bring. Your&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;rankings will undeniably improve, as one website will be evaluated as the main source. Most importantly, your positive user experience will generate new users, potentially converting them into customers &#8211; increasing your sales ratio, benefiting your business.</p>
