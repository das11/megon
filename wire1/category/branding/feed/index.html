<p>Branding is everything. The way your current and prospective customers view your company&#8217;s brand has an enormous impact on your bottom line.</p>



<p>Company branding is essential, to say the least. Done the wrong way, it could ruin your business. Done right, it could spur your business to new heights.</p>



<p>Get the go-to guide for ideas, tips, and more by reading on.</p>



<h2><strong>The Best In Company Branding</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/branding-services/">Branding</a> is related to everything your company does, in some way. Whether your business is small, large, B2B, or retail, it needs to maximize the power of its brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your brand is your promise to your customer. It sets your product apart from the pack. It also tells your customers what to expect from your services and products.</p>



<p>Your brand starts with your logo. Your promotional items, packaging, and website materials should all integrate your logo to communicate your brand.</p>



<p>First, define your brand by answering some key questions. What&#8217;s your company&#8217;s mission? What is the look and feel you want? What do you want your brand to convey?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are the features and benefits of your services or products? What qualities do you want customers to associate with your brand?</p>



<p>Next up is your brand&#8217;s strategy. This is how, when, where, what, and to whom you plan on delivering and communicating your brand messages.</p>



<p>You need to decide where to advertise, what <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-channel.asp#:~:text=A%20distribution%20channel%20represents%20a,sells%20directly%20to%20the%20consumer.">distribution channels</a> to use, and how you communicate verbally and visually.</p>



<h2><strong>Your Highly Valuable Brand</strong></h2>



<p>Strategic branding builds brand equity. That&#8217;s the value added to your company&#8217;s services or products that lets you charge more for your brand than unbranded, identical products.</p>



<p>Think of Coca-Cola, for example, which can charge more than a generic brand because of its brand equity. Such equity&#8217;s added value often comes in the form of emotional attachment or perceived quality.</p>



<p>You achieve <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/propointgraphics/2017/07/08/building-brand-equity/?sh=6158cf516e8f">brand equity</a> by spreading the word about your business. Choose a logo and put it everywhere.</p>



<p>Integrate your brand into the way you answer the phone, your email signature, what you or your salespeople wear on sales calls, and more. Create a tagline that concisely captures your brand&#8217;s essence.</p>



<p>Develop a company voice that reflects your brand in all written communication and is used in all materials&#8217; visual imagery. Make templates and brand standards for your marketing materials that feature the same logo placement, color scheme, feel, and look throughout.</p>



<p>Stay true to your brand. You won&#8217;t keep customers and they won&#8217;t refer you if your results don&#8217;t fulfill your brand&#8217;s promises.</p>



<h2><strong>A Powerful Brand</strong></h2>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have cohesive company branding already, get started on it today. It&#8217;s never too late (or too soon) to build a highly marketable, powerful brand for your business.</p>



<p>A brand isn&#8217;t just a logo. It&#8217;s the feeling and memories of excellence that you&#8217;ll leave in your customers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/contact-us/">Contact us today</a> and let our professionals build an unmatched brand for your company.</p>

<p>For a burgeoning business, there&#8217;s little more valuable than creating a solid brand, and building awareness around it. This is why <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/#topbrandingstatisticseditorschoice:~:text=Over%2070%25%20of%20brand%20managers%20consider%20building%20an%20audience%20more%20important%20than%20converting%20sales.,-89%25">over 70% of brand managers</a> say building an audience more important than converting sales.</p>



<p>Boosting brand awareness is vital for many reasons. It allows consumers to get to know your company better and it enables you to create the narrative you want around your business. It also makes your brand more memorable and instantly recognizable.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s been proven that people don&#8217;t just care about products anymore, they care about the brands behind them almost as much. Digital marketing is one of the fastest and most effective ways to curate your company&#8217;s branding and <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/310427">build brand awareness</a>. Read on to find out how.</p>



<h2><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></h2>



<p>Over the past 10 years or so, SEO has become one of the biggest digital marketing channels there is. With good reason. SEO is an amazing tool that allows you to connect with consumers who are specifically seeking products or services like yours.</p>



<p>When employed in the right way, it drives more traffic to your website which, in turn, gets more eyes on your brand. This is why ultimately, this strategy is one of the best ways to <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-big-benefits-of-seo-for-your-business/#post-3010:~:text=3.%20Strengthen%20Brand%20Awareness,strengthen%20your%20brand%20awareness%20over%20time.">increase brand recognition and awareness</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Content Marketing</strong></h2>



<p>Content marketing is another powerful digital marketing tool that serves a unique purpose in building brand identity and awareness. By creating quality content such as blogs, videos, and ebooks, you can establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry. You can also use your content to solidify and amplify your brand message, whatever that may be.</p>



<p>All of these things will help in creating a strong brand identity, which, again, will make your brand more memorable and recognizable to customers. It will also act as an encouragement to consumers, with whom your message resonates, to purchase your product over your competition’s product.</p>



<h2><strong>Social Media</strong></h2>



<p>One of the great things about building a brand is that it allows you to connect with your audience on a deeper level. This is an authentic way of <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/the-key-importance-of-building-a-brand-for-your-business/#post-3007:~:text=Build%20Credibility%20in%20Your%20Industry,develop%20even%20more%20trust%20and%20credibility.">increasing credibility and building trust</a> with your audience. There are few places that this is easier done than on your brand&#8217;s social media channels.</p>



<p>Social media allows you to curate your brand&#8217;s message and aesthetics. Branding consistency across social media channels has been proven to increase brand recognition. Social media also offers you a unique chance to interact directly with your audience, which makes your brand more relatable, accessible, and likable.</p>

<p>A website is one of the most important <a href="https://medium.com/@oliosolutions/8-reasons-why-a-website-is-important-for-your-business-success-d833205380e">digital marketing tools</a> your business has. It&#8217;s available 24 hours a day for potential customers, so you want to make sure they can access the information they want when they want it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s important to have a website, you also need to make sure your web design is innovative and in line with the current trends. If you want to know what&#8217;s on the horizon in web page design for 2021, read on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Parallax Animations</strong></h2>



<p>Parallax scrolling is a design technique where the images in the foreground move faster than the images in the background. This gives your site visitors a 3D effect as they are scrolling through the various pages of your site and creates almost an immersive effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While parallax scrolling isn&#8217;t new this year, it is gaining in popularity and you&#8217;ll see it incorporated into websites more and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Soothing Colors</strong></h2>



<p>We spend more than <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/people-are-spending-most-of-their-waking-hours-staring-at-screens-2018-08-01">11 hours per day</a> staring at screens—laptops, phones, tablets, televisions, etc. More of our waking hours are spent in front of screens than not, so it&#8217;s imperative that your website has a color that is <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/2021-design-trends-that-will-shape-the-web/">easy on the eyes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neutral color schemes that are pleasing and soothing to your eyes are becoming more and more popular. Think soft color palettes like pastel blues and greens, warm browns, and light pink. Combined with the dark mode trend, which reduces some of the white we see on screens, these colors can invoke relaxation and calm the viewer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Augmented Reality&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Another immersive experience is augmented reality or AR. AR allows the user to see objects that exist in real life in a computer-generated experience. Car dealers are using this more and more to allow consumers to experience the car without ever setting foot on a car lot.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Horizontal Scrolling</strong></h2>



<p>Horizontal scrolling on a webpage was once a big no-no, but if done properly and used sparingly, it can be an effective tool for image galleries however. For example, a photographer could use horizontal scrolling to convey information through a gallery of pictures that the user scrolls through.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to use horizontal scrolling, be sure you give the user an alternative means to see the content, such as arrows or buttons that are clearly labeled.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3D Visuals</strong></h2>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses to adapt in ways they never imagined. Stay-at-home orders and orders to shut down certain business services have necessitated that more and more industries incorporate 3D visuals. You can see inside restaurants, commercial and residential properties, and other businesses all from the comfort of your own home.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Incorporate These Web Design Trends Into Your Site&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re ready to take your web design to the next level, it&#8217;s time to incorporate some of these new trends for 2021. A site that is current, aesthetically pleasing, and shows visitors that you are in tune to current trends demonstrates that your business is on the cutting edge and also keeps visitors on your site longer.</p>

<p>Content marketing is essential for any brand&#8217;s story. If you want to <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/content-marketing-statistics">build brand awareness and trust over 75%</a>, you need to invest in compelling content. Establishing a narrative provides consumers with consistent messaging and clarity.</p>



<p>The more consumers understand your business, the better your ROI and lead generation. Read this guide to elevate your marketing with essential brand storytelling.</p>



<h2><strong>What Is Brand Storytelling?</strong></h2>



<p>When most people think of marketing, the first thought to cross their minds is usually about advertising. Some might think of memorable jingles, clever characters, or other brand icons. These all play a part in how to tell a story about a company.</p>



<p>In digital marketing, telling a brand story starts with answering a few basic questions. These questions are often critical to your business&#8217;s daily functions and core offerings. You&#8217;ll want to consider the following:</p>



<ol><li>What&#8217;s your reason for being in business?</li><li>How did your business come to be?</li><li>Who&#8217;s the face of your company?</li><li>What makes your business unique?</li><li>Which failures have impacted your company?</li></ol>



<p>Answering these questions can help write a story showcasing your brand&#8217;s voice. With a clear voice, your messaging becomes clearer. And the more clearly consumers recognize your brand, the more they&#8217;ll trust and purchase from your company.</p>



<p>Combined with the right marketing strategy, these answers provide valuable insight to current and potential customers. You can hone ongoing and upcoming campaigns with better-targeted narratives, too. The most important focus for telling a brand&#8217;s story is the <a href="https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/centers/oralcommunication/guides/how-to-engage-your-audience-and-keep-them-with-you">focus on your audience</a>, after all.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Boost Your Digital Marketing Through Storytelling</strong></h2>



<p>Now you know what brand storytelling is, it&#8217;s time to break down how to tell a story for your marketing. Crafting a narrative is all about communicating with your audience. You need to know who you currently serve and compare that to who you want to serve.</p>



<p>You can use a few factors to leverage your company values and history. When you combine these factors, you&#8217;ll end up with a successful brand strategy. Consider these elements when aligning narratives within your content marketing.</p>



<ul><li>Audience profile: current and prospective people, based on ideal clients and buyer personas</li><li>Tone of voice: how you craft content (e.g., professional, enthusiastic, friendly)</li><li><a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/a-guide-to-writing-the-perfect-company-boilerplate-text">Boilerplate paragraph</a>: standard communication for consistent messaging</li><li>Messaging scenarios: possible interaction points with current and prospective consumers</li></ul>



<p>When you consider these elements, along with the answers about your brand, you can write a story for your brand. A trusted and relatable brand story combines these elements successfully. <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/branding-services/">Expert branding services</a> can help you integrate them correctly.</p>



<h2><strong>Tell Your Brand&#8217;s Story With a Holistic Approach</strong></h2>

<p>Brand consistency can <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/blog/branding-statistics">increase revenue by a third</a>. One way to ensure your brand description stays consistent is through a properly formatted tool. Consistent messaging is critical when communicating across platforms and media.</p>



<p>Learn how to write the perfect boilerplate text for your company&#8217;s marketing with this guide. Boost your online presence and virtual impressions with well-crafted content.</p>



<h2><strong>What Makes a Company Boilerplate?</strong></h2>



<p>Your boilerplate text needs to include basic elements. These components ensure your text is standardized for consistent messaging. Your boilerplate should include:</p>



<ul><li>Date and place of company founding</li><li>Products and services</li><li>Company mission</li><li>Milestones, awards, and honors</li><li>Social media accounts</li><li>Contact information</li></ul>



<p>These are essential details for your company boilerplate. Make sure to prioritize brevity and relevance for quick reference. Your boilerplate is all about streamlining content marketing.</p>



<h2><strong>The Extras In Your Brand Description</strong></h2>



<p>For a fuller and more comprehensive boilerplate, you can include other details, too. Including these details is ultimately up to your current marketing strategy. These may be unnecessary or add a little extra to your brand description.</p>



<ul><li>Company founders: ideal for older companies with well-known, established faces</li><li>Size and location: noteworthy company sizes should be shared; think 300 or more employees</li><li>Revenue and funding: if you&#8217;ve made a lot, share it, especially if backed by a famous client</li><li>Customers and users: mention this if you&#8217;ve got an impressive amount of customers&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Consistent messaging ensures accessible information about your company. This helps present a cohesive brand story and demonstrates your credibility and professionalism. There are ways to use boilerplate to boost your marketing, too.</p>



<h2><strong>Content Marketing and Boilerplate Go Together Like&#8230;</strong></h2>



<p>With all the essentials and extras for a company boilerplate, it&#8217;s important to find ways to optimize it. Everything you include in your boilerplate can boost your marketing strategy. Boilerplate is just another form of content, after all.</p>



<p>Writing a boilerplate is straightforward. It&#8217;s important to emphasize things specific to the core of your company. Your brand description should be brief and appealing to add clarity and power.</p>



<p>Most importantly, you should optimize your text for readers and search engines. The most relevant keywords, alongside a strong CTA, elevate your content marketing. The call to action ensures people find more about your brand.</p>



<h3><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget to Take a Stand</strong></h3>



<p>The key ingredient to any elevator pitch is a strong position. The same goes for creating a boilerplate. You can&#8217;t have one without a positioning statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positioning statement expresses why your company is important. The statement is no more than one sentence and showcases your company&#8217;s main accomplishment.</p>



<h2><strong>Boost More Than Your Boilerplate Text With a Holistic Approach</strong></h2>



<p>Your company boilerplate isn&#8217;t the only thing clients and partners see. Your content and other elements of your marketing impact your virtual presence. A holistic approach from branding to web design to ad content impacts your appearance online.</p>



<p>Now you know how to write boilerplate text, you&#8217;re ready to elevate other parts of your digital presence.

<p>So you have an idea for your business, but you haven&#8217;t launched your website yet. You might think that choosing a domain name will be an easy and straightforward process, but choosing the wrong name can have huge consequences. You don&#8217;t want your brand to suffer because you chose an <a href="https://conflict-news.com/domain-names/">unfortunate domain name</a>.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re here to help you avoid that mistake. We&#8217;ll teach you how to choose a domain name for your business that fits your brand.</p>



<p>Here are five key tips you need to know before choosing your domain name.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Choose .Com Domains</strong></h2>



<p>When choosing a domain name, you have several options for top-level domains (TLDs). TLDs include .com, .org, .biz, .net, .edu and so on. Of course, .com domains continue to remain <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/com-vs-net-vs-us-3467135">one of the most popular</a> options.</p>



<p>When you have the option, choose a .com TLD. However, if that domain isn&#8217;t available, it&#8217;s not the end of the world. You can <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/best-domain-extensions-com-not-available/132321/">get creative</a> with your domain name, such as rearranging the words or choosing another relevant TLD such as .blog or .store instead.</p>



<h2><strong>2. It Doesn&#8217;t Have to Match Your Business Name</strong></h2>



<p>Your domain doesn&#8217;t have to be word-for-word the same as your business name. For example, if you have a longer business name, you might not want every word in your domain. Instead, you could consider shortening the domain to an acronym.</p>



<p>In some instances, you may want to add location information. If you&#8217;re a local plumber in North Carolina and your target customers are local, you might want to add NC to the domain.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Think About SEO</strong></h2>



<p>SEO plays a <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/4-big-benefits-of-seo-for-your-business/">huge part</a> in targeting traffic and raising brand awareness. Many businesses will use keywords during a domain name registration. Keywords tell visitors what to expect from your business and also that you specialize in that area.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unsure which keywords to target or whether it might make your domain too long, consult with a digital marketing agency that specializes in <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/internet-marketing/">internet marketing</a> and <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">web development</a>. That way, you can work together toward your goals and choose the right domain name for your business.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Keep It Short</strong></h2>



<p>Long, complicated domains won&#8217;t do your business any favors. Names that are tricky to remember aren&#8217;t going to stick in your customers&#8217; minds.</p>



<p>The ideal length for a website domain is somewhere between 6-14 characters. The shorter, the better in most cases. If it&#8217;s short, sweet, easy to remember, and reflects your brand, you&#8217;ve got a winner.</p>



<h2><strong>5. It Reflects Your Brand</strong></h2>



<p>Lastly, it&#8217;s important to remember that this domain will reflect your brand. Make sure the tone reflects your business. For example, it could be funny, clever, or professional sounding, but it should reflect the tone of your brand.</p>

<p>The average business owner hears a lot about branding. Most people think about branding as your logo, your products, and your services. While those are definitely included in the definition of a brand, there&#8217;s a lot more to it than that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A brand <em>is your business&#8217;s identity</em>. It is your reputation, your message, and everything your business stands for. Consumers will use your brand to determine the competence and credibility of your business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, building a brand is vital to your success. But don&#8217;t just take our word for it. Keep reading for the top reasons why you need to establish a strong, recognizable brand for your company.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Define Your Business</h2>



<p>One of the most fundamental purposes of building a brand for your business is to show consumers what your business is all about. Your brand should define your business, its priorities, and its values. In this way, brand building helps businesses connect with past, present, and future customers on a deeper level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Branding can also be important for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/09/16/14-ways-to-build-more-meaningful-professional-relationships/">building other professional relationships</a>. This includes relationships with employees, independent contractors, affiliate businesses, social media influencers, and more.</p>



<h2>Improve Recognition Among Consumers&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Learning how to build a brand is about standing out from other companies in your industry. Your company needs to be easily recognizable. The easier it is to recognize your business, the more comfortable consumers will feel buying from you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Design a creative logo that isn&#8217;t overly complicated. Additionally, use a unique and aesthetically pleasing color scheme to help individualize your brand.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Generate Leads and Make Sales</h2>



<p>One of the most encouraging benefits of <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/branding-services/">building a brand</a> is the potential for increased revenue. As your brand gets stronger and more recognizable, it will be easy to attract new customers and generate more sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a popular brand, you have built-in reliability and credibility. Most consumers won&#8217;t think twice before buying from you. You can increase this effect by publishing customer reviews and testimonials.</p>



<h2>Increase the Value of Your Business</h2>



<p>Building a brand increases the value of your business, especially as you become more popular among consumers. Strong brand development will grant you more leverage in the market. This is essential for building affiliate relationships with other businesses and collaborating with social media influencers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as importantly, strong business branding may be important for future investors in your company. You can attract potential buyers if you decide to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/08/sell-small-business.asp">sell your business</a> and leverage your company for more money.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Build Credibility in Your Industry&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The stronger your brand is, the more credibility your business will have in the industry. If consumers are familiar with your company, they&#8217;ll choose your products or services before those of a lesser-known company.</p>



<p>A strongly branded business is presented as an authority in the field. Consumers will see you as an expert in your trade. Use content marketing to publish valuable and informative articles, emails, and social media posts to develop even more trust and credibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Need Help Building a Brand?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to increase the value of your company, generate more leads, and make more sales, building a brand should be your top priority. However, we understand that this takes time, effort, and know-how. You may require a little assistance.&nbsp;We&#8217;d love to help you take your business to the next level.

<p>Around <a href="https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-numbers/branding-statistics/#gref">89% of consumers</a> are loyal to brands they perceive as sharing their values. Learning about the differences between branding vs marketing will help you understand both terms better.</p>



<p>Brands with blogs generate 67% more leads than brands without blogs. Blogging serves both branding and marketing purposes, but how can you tell which is happening at any given moment?</p>



<p>You&#8217;ve invested hard work and money into your business. You deserve to have the ability to differentiate branding from marketing.</p>



<p>Here are five important differences between marketing and branding:</p>



<h2>1. Brands Set Expectations</h2>



<p>Sure, brands have visual components like brand colors and logos, but they also have intangible qualities such as brand personality, brand values, and more. Either way, your brand revolves around expectations you&#8217;ve set for your audience.</p>



<p>Your brand has a unique identity with features that make it stand out from the competition. Your branding strategy shapes your brand personality while your marketing strategy promotes it. When your marketing efforts match your branding efforts, you target your audience right.</p>



<h2>2. Marketing Relies On Sharing</h2>



<p>If branding defines what your business is and why it exists, marketing flaunts those qualities to generate sales and conversions. The best marketing messages overlap with your brand messages well.</p>



<p>Marketing efforts depend on sharing and communication. Even with a big brand personality, your brand will only do so well if you don&#8217;t get out there and market it accordingly.</p>



<p>Tailor your marketing strategy around communicating marketing messages that resonate with your audience. The greater that resonance is, the more sales you&#8217;ll attract.</p>



<h2>3. Emotions and Consumer Connection</h2>



<p>Both company branding and marketing involve creating an emotional connection with consumers. Brands strive to stand out by evoking powerful emotions in relation to their brand identities. Branding efforts consist of anything from <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/how-to-build-brand-awareness/">increasing brand awareness</a> with clever memes to designing your brand&#8217;s online website.</p>



<p>Marketing also aims to inspire emotions for the sake of generating sales, leads, and other conversions. It supports a brand&#8217;s mission and the feelings it inspires by sharing that mission with the world. Striking the right emotional chords with your audience equals more sales for you.</p>



<h2>4. Tactics vs. Positioning</h2>



<p>Marketing is more tactical in nature than branding is. After all, marketing focuses on short-term selling tactics.</p>



<p>Branding, however, is more about strategy. It relies on long-term positioning to develop and maintain a strong brand that boosts a business&#8217;s value.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why brand marketing is such a different beast! It involves promoting your products/services in a way that highlights your entire brand. It requires both long-term brand positioning and short-term selling tactics for success.</p>



<h2>5. Social Media Differences</h2>



<p>Social media marketing is different from social media branding. This proves that branding and marketing efforts interact with social media differently.</p>



<p>Social media marketing involves promoting products/services on social media to generate sales. Social media branding involves spreading brand awareness and bolstering brand messages through posts.</p>



<h2>Branding vs Marketing: You Need Both For Success</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.business2community.com/marketing/30-marketing-statistics-to-consider-for-2020-02305426">90% of Instagram&#8217;s active users</a> follow at least one business on the platform. When it comes to branding vs marketing, Instagram wins both ways.</p>



<p>Instagram has 1 million monthly active users alone. Just think of all of the other digital marketing opportunities available online!</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a little healthy competition. Beating your competitors in business will help you grab a larger slice of the pie, but having competitors can also push you to achieve and do more with your brand. If you really want to come out on top, you need to know who you&#8217;re competing with and how to overcome them.</p>



<p>This is where competitive market research can make a world of difference. Whether you&#8217;re launching a business or searching for new opportunities in your market, this guide to analyzing your direct competitors will help you build a better brand and extend your customer reach.</p>



<h2>Find Your Audience</h2>



<p>To start a competitor analysis, you should identify at least one competitor to study. Ideally, you&#8217;ll want to identify between three to five competitors to cover a wider range within your market. Then, you can dive into the research to understand the customer each company targets.</p>



<p>While doing so, pay attention to the type of language they use in their brand messaging. You should also look at each platform they use to spread their messaging. For example, are they on Twitter, Instagram, or both?</p>



<p>Learning this type of information will help you better understand your brand&#8217;s audience. If one competitor owns a chunk of the market for a certain customer type, you could focus on a niche within that base or a different customer instead. You can also learn from their communication techniques, which will help you understand how to better <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/the-art-of-brand-positioning/">position your brand</a>.</p>



<h2>Fine-tune Your Brand Voice and Messaging</h2>



<p>When you know where your competition posts, you can begin studying the type of content they create and the cadence at which they publish it. You can also take a look at the level of engagement each post receives. In essence, you will learn what works for your competition and what doesn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>If you see that positive, light-hearted posts work well for your competition on Instagram, you can try emulating that approach in your own brand voice. If you see your competition doesn&#8217;t post often on Twitter, you can increase your cadence and gain more ground on that platform. Through this research, you can find unique ways to stand out from the competition.</p>



<p>These methods will help you refine your own <a href="https://medium.com/s/how-to-build-a-brand/lets-talk-about-brand-personality-voice-and-tone-28276a48d5c1">brand voice and messaging</a>, leading to higher engagement rates and more brand recognition with customers.</p>



<h2>Discover Hidden Opportunities</h2>

You can capitalize on this hidden opportunity by filling that gap before the competition.</p>



<p>These hidden opportunities don&#8217;t stop there, either. You can uncover a variety of new ways to approach the market and <a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-competitive-analysis-strategic-planning-18331.html">edge out the competition</a>.</p>



<h2>Analyzing Your Direct Competitors Can Help You Beat Them</h2>



<p>To beat your direct competitors, you must know everything about them. A competitor analysis will reveal their strengths and weaknesses, and in the process, you can find the edge that will take your brand to the next level.</p>

<p>For the first time, digital marketing expenditure is expected to account for <a href="https://adage.com/article/datacenter/new-milestone-internet-will-account-half-ad-spending-2020/2223511">over half</a> of all marketing spend. And odds are, you&#8217;re one of the thousands of businesses increasing your online marketing budget this year.</p>



<p>Still, you need to make sure you&#8217;re spending your money in the smartest possible way. That means focusing on online marketing strategies with proven track records!</p>



<p>So what&#8217;s worth focusing on? Keep reading to learn about five of the best marketing strategies you&#8217;ll want to use.</p>



<h2>1. Build a Brand</h2>



<p>Audiences are tired of dealing with bland, faceless companies. These days, the most successful businesses are the ones who can tap into the human experience, offering a warmer, more personalized marketing strategy.</p>



<p>Improving your <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/how-to-build-brand-awareness/">branding and brand awareness</a> can help you diversify your company from the competition while relating to your target audience.</p>



<p>To start, establish your <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/the-art-of-brand-positioning/">brand&#8217;s positioning statement</a>. This statement identifies your exact audience, your goals, and specifics on how you intend to address your customers&#8217; needs.</p>



<h2>2. Offer a Cohesive Web Experience</h2>



<p>Another fantastic way to enhance your branding is by building a <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/web-development/">fast, accessible website</a>.</p>



<p>These days, accessibility means taking a mobile-first approach. Mobile internet growth has <a href="https://hostingtribunal.com/blog/mobile-percentage-of-traffic/">increased by 504%</a> since 2011 and continues to grow in popularity each year.</p>



<p>By allowing people to access your website and its content from anywhere, on any device, you&#8217;re opening yourself up for broader appeal.</p>



<h2>3. Inform, Don&#8217;t Sell</h2>



<p>As mentioned before, today&#8217;s audience is savvier than ever, which means they&#8217;re aware of traditional marketing tactics. In many cases, that awareness leads to active resistance, making online marketing for small businesses even harder.</p>



<p>However, you can still reach your audience &#8212; and promote your products or services in the process &#8212; by offering helpful, relatable, and informative content.</p>



<p>Your content should address your audience&#8217;s pain points as outlined in your positioning statement. Moreover, make sure to include a strong call-to-action (CTA) at the end of each blog and social media post, as well as videos and emails.</p>



<h2>4. Leverage the Latest SEO and PPC Techniques</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;ve tried your hand at search engine optimization (SEO) and its sister technique, <a href="https://www.dgstudio.com/learn-the-basics-of-ppc/">pay-per-click marketing</a> (PPC), you know how overwhelming modern marketing can be.</p>



<p>Still, ignoring SEO and PPC isn&#8217;t an option anymore.</p>



<p>Studies show that the top result on Google generates <a href="https://www.searchenginewatch.com/2013/06/20/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study/">33% of all traffic</a> for a given query. By capitalizing on simple SEO techniques like link building, web accessibility, and content marketing, you&#8217;ll improve your company&#8217;s visibility, and in turn, your business.</p>



<h2>5. Prioritize Reputation Management</h2>



<p>One of the most significant online marketing tactics doesn&#8217;t require much change from your business at all!</p>



<p>Customer reviews are powerful enough that they&#8217;re as effective, if not more, than actual advertising. Therefore, be sure to keep up with your company&#8217;s reputation.</p>



<p>Negative reviews can lead to a spiral of lost business. But if you&#8217;re shrewd about your responses and righting any wrongs, you&#8217;ll quickly establish yourself as a trustworthy company that your audience can trust.</p>



<h2>Grow Your Business With These Online Marketing Strategies</h2>



<p>Any of these five online marketing strategies can take your business to the next level. But together, you&#8217;ll have a robust, full-fledged marketing campaign that can help your business skyrocket.</p>
