They weren't too pushy and I sensed their commitment and confidence in helping me upgrade my website. It was a complex journey and they covered every detail I wanted to see changed. The site is beautiful, and lets viewers easily see what I am about as an expert in my field - ready, willing, and able to help those in need of my quality information on how teach themselves or their kids to swim starting at home without a pool. They are a great team; detail oriented, and great listeners so they can suggest ways to accomplish what I wanted efficiently. Sort of like how I teach swimming to help save more lives. Their marketing team suggested ways using my extensive video content to improve my social media presence I never thought of doing so I can get higher on the Internet search pages and be found.

I have been involved in designing and arranging many souvenirs for the SLAASC and other organizations. I have also seen the hard work of many of our Sri Lankan organizations and Colleges who put out souvenirs for their functions. I do realize that it takes a lot of time and effort to put these souvenirs together. I feel I must CONGRATULATE the Sri Lanka Foundation and your graphic department DG Studio for their production of this Souvenir. I feel it is the best, by any standards, that I have ever seen. It is a MASTERPIECE! Obviously they went through a lot in making it perfect. Every ad has meaning and stands out. You have set a standard for other organizations, who will find it extremely difficult to meet with. Thanks also to those involved in putting together the ad for “Good News From Jayam”. It was excellent and I have received a good response from the ad. Keep up the good work. My compliments to DG Studio."</p>
